        "content": "This is a beta feature and we would love to hear your feedback?\n\nSend us your feedback to audioarticles@vaarta.com\n\nAirline passengers, already leery of rambunctious behavior and even real-life snakes on planes, may have yet one more thing to add to their list of potential in-flight disruptions: maggots. The wriggly white creatures of decay and waste have now made their way to the topic of flight disruptions.\n\nOn Tuesday, Delta Air Lines Flight 133 took off from Amsterdam, Netherlands, heading for Detroit, Michigan. \"However, just one hour into the journey, the Airbus A330-300 turned back to Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport after maggots reportedly fell onto a passenger from an overhead bin,\" the Detroit TV station FOX 2 (WJBK) reported.\n\nPhilip Schotte, from Iowa, by way of the Netherlands, was on the flight and told WCAX-TV what happened. \"She was asking what these black dots are on my lap,\" Schotte said. Schotte told the station that the flight crew eventually traced the maggots to a passenger's bag, which contained rotten fish wrapped in newspaper. The bag was moved to the back of the plane, and it was announced that the plane would return to Amsterdam.\n\nSchotte eventually boarded another US-bound flight, which departed hours later. According to flight-tracking data from FlightAware, Flight 133 was airborne for only one hour and 49 minutes before returning.\n\nDelta Air Lines confirmed to CNN that the flight had to return but did not answer questions regarding the maggots. The airline apologized to the customers on Flight 133 AMS-DTW and explained that the flight was disrupted by a handbag that was not properly packed. The aircraft was withdrawn from service for cleaning, and passengers were transferred to the next available flight.\n\nAs for perishable food, such as fish, there is no such ban on the board of the Delta aircraft, other than agriculture restrictions in the country of origin.",

        "title": "Longer Spring Festival holiday sparks travel frenzy among Chinese",
        "content": "An aerial drone photo taken on February 14 shows tourists watching a folk art parade in Chongchuan District of Nantong City, east China's Jiangsu Province. More Chinese people nowadays choose to go on a journey during the Spring Festival to experience different cultures and lunar new year atmosphere (XINHUA)\n\nFor the Chinese people, the eternal theme of the Spring Festival, or Chinese New Year, remains family reunion, yet an increasing number of Chinese are choosing to integrate travel into their holiday traditions.\n\nThe change was seen this year as the Spring Festival holiday spanned eight days--possibly nine with a flexible one-day paid leave--surpassing the usual one-week holiday in previous years.\n\nAccording to data released on February 17 by Chinese travel website Mafengwo, February 12 and 13 saw peak travel activity.\n\n\"We made a random decision to drive to the historic city of Datong (in northern China) on February 12 but were surprised to see a large number of tourists. Local hotel chains are almost always full, and restaurants almost always have a waiting line,\" said a tourist surnamed Li.\n\nNew trends in domestic tourism\n\nAccording to Mafengwo, family travel accounted for 45 percent of all trips during the holiday, reflecting a trend that young people return home for family reunions before embarking on trips with their families, taking advantage of the extended holiday period.\n\nBeijing, Xi'an and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area were among the most popular tourist destinations, said Mafengwo, adding that visiting museums, grottoes, temples and other historical and cultural places was another highlight of this year's Spring Festival travel after temple fairs and folk activities.\n\nA report by travel portal Tuniu.com showed an emerging trend for cross-regional travel between the northern and southern parts of the country during the holiday.\n\nHarbin, capital of northeastern Heilongjiang Province, maintained its growing popularity among people from the South who are eager to explore an ice-and-snow world, while tropical cities such as Sanya, Xishuangbanna, and Beihai remained favored destinations for northlanders seeking winter getaways.\n\nSurging outbound tourism\n\nData from multiple online travel platforms showed that on the first day of the eight-day holiday, outbound travel bookings already surpassed the 2019 figure, with Southeast Asian countries, particularly those with visa-free policies for Chinese nationals, emerging as red-hot destinations.\n\nFrom Feb. 10 to 13, bookings for hotels in Bangkok tripled year on year, while reservations for Singaporean hotels reported a stunning growth of 800 percent, according to the travel platform LY.com.\n\nSeveral European destinations have introduced unique strategies to attract Chinese tourists. A Michelin-starred restaurant in downtown London has launched a menu specially designed for the Year of the Loong (Dragon), while a railway for the well-known scenic spot Jungfrau in Switzerland has been decorated with Chinese elements to greet Chinese tourists between February 8 and 20.\n\nWith a substantial rise in outbound tourism, this holiday is projected to see a daily port clearance of 1.8 million people nationwide, more than triple that of the previous year and nearly reaching the level of 2019, according to the National Immigration Administration.\n\nAccording to a market forecast by Ctrip, a leading travel platform in China, the eight-day holiday would mark the country's first travel rush of the year, with a notable increase in international travel being one of the highlights.\n\n\"Destinations in Southeast Asia have continued to gain traction as many in China opted for the region for an escape from the winter season,\" said Gao Tao, from Tuniu. \"The tourism industry has gone through a rough patch in the past three years due to the pandemic. But it is now poised for a growth spurt, particularly in outbound tourism.\"\n\nIn 2023, China saw its outbound passenger trips exceed 87 million, and this figure is projected to reach 130 million in 2024, according to a paper published by the China Tourism Academy.\n\nUpward momentum\n\nExperts believe that the revved-up Spring Festival tourism consumption heralds an upward momentum in the tourism sector in 2024.\n\nIn a recent report, the China Tourism Academy estimated that over 6 billion domestic trips will be made in 2024, and the total number of inbound and outbound travelers is expected to exceed 260 million.\n\n\"With the recovery of the economy, the resumption of international flights and the relaxation of visa policies, it is expected that the scale of domestic tourism consumption will continue to grow in 2024, and the scale of outbound tourism will be comprehensively advanced,\" said Qi Chunguang, vice president of Tuniu.",

        "content": "The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria has reopened the 3.9km Runway 18R/36L of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos after almost 11 months of maintenance repairs.\n\nIn March 2023, FAAN announced the temporary closure of the international runway 18R/36L of the Lagos airport. The maintenance was reportedly meant to last for eight weeks.\n\nThe closure had disrupted air traffic and airlines' schedules, having extended beyond the expected timeframe.\n\nDuring the repairs period, both international and local airlines were using the runway 18L/36R, a shorter runway that is meant to handle only domestic flights.\n\nHowever, Links 2 and 3 of the taxiway are now operational, providing international airlines an alternative runway, aside from the domestic 18L/36R runway.\n\nThe reopened runway 18R/36L has a length of 3,900 m (12,794 ft) and a width of 60 m (197 ft)\n\nKenya Airways has already utilised the reopened runway, receiving a ceremonial welcome, marking the runway's return to service.\n\nAlso Qatar Airways also landed on the runway around past 11am on Saturday.\n\nEarlier, the Nigerian Airspace had issued a Notice to Airmen, announcing the opening of the runway after midnight of February 15. However, due to last-minute that had yet to be closed, inspectors of the regulatory authority Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority stopped airlines from using the runway.\n\nHowever, around 10am on Saturday, over 24 hours after the NOTAM was issued, airlines were eventually cleared to land on the runway.\n\nThe opening of the runway will provide succour for local and foreign airlines which use the airport.\n\nDuring a recent inspection tour of vehicular movement at MMIA, the Managing Director of FAAN, Olubunmi Kuku, had hinted that the runway 18R/36L would soon be opened.\n\nShe disclosed ongoing efforts, led by the Nigeria Airspace Management Agency and the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority, and Airline Operators of Nigeria to expedite the process through an interim method.\n\nThe FAAN MG noted, \"Concerning the 18Right runway, we did have some delays initially. Coming on board, we have asked that the contractor return to the site immediately. We have all the support from the Honorable Minister and the Permanent Secretary. \"The reopening is planned for the next few weeks. We are keeping our fingers crossed. I know that our stakeholders have been waiting. We are working very closely to get it reopened.\n\n\"I am certain that it will not be as long as you waited. I do understand that the initial plan for that runway is six weeks. We will do our best. We did have some delays,\" she said.\n\nDespite unexpected setbacks, Kuku affirmed FAAN's dedication to minimising additional delays and ensuring a seamless resumption of operations.\n\nThe MMIA holds its position as Nigeria's busiest airport, serving as a vital hub for both domestic and international airlines.\n\nThe airport operates two runways - 18R/36L for international traffic and 18L/36R for domestic operations.\n\nThe domestic runway faced limitations for over 14 years due to the absence of airfield lighting and other components.\n\nIn November 2022, Air Field Light was successfully fixed, including approach lights, runway lights (Threshold and Centre), edge lights, and others, enabling the domestic runway to resume full 24/7 operations.\n\nAfter the installation of airfield lighting at the domestic runway, the international runway (18R) underwent maintenance.\n\nDuring this time of maintenance, international traffic was redirected to the domestic runway, which is now fully equipped with airfield lighting and other facilities for seamless 24-hour operation.\n\nAccording to experts, runway closures pose financial challenges for airlines and airports alike.\n\nSuch closures can lead to increased costs for airlines and a direct loss of revenue for airports.\n\nAirports generate income through landing charges to airlines, and when a runway is closed, this revenue stream is adversely affected.",

        "content": "SCARBOROUGH, Tobago (Reuters) -Nine days after a slick was first spotted by Trinidad and Tobago's Coast Guard, an oil leak from a capsized barge remains unplugged, according to first responders and authorities, prompting nations across the Caribbean to coordinate a response.\n\nThe spill has spread miles from Tobago's shore, the area first hit by the incident. Trinidad this week alerted neighbors Venezuela and Grenada on possible impact to their coasts.\n\nThe Caribbean Disaster Management Agency, dependent on regional group Caricom, has activated a contingency plan, the head of Tobago's Emergency Management Agency (TEMA), Allan Stewart, said on Friday.\n\nA barge pulled by a tugboat caused the spill, but details of the incident remain unclear, including the type of petroleum leaking, the ship's intended destination, owner and if any members of the crew were lost.\n\nBy Thursday, the slick had reached about 144 km (89 miles) into the Caribbean Sea and was moving at a rate of 14 km (9 miles) per hour, authorities said.\n\n\"This looks like it will continue for a few weeks. I cannot simply sit down and do nothing,\" said Edwin Ramkisson, who makes a living fishing for snapper and salmon in Lowlands, on Tobago's Atlantic shore. \"I need help cleaning my boat before moving to another port on the Caribbean side.\"\n\nThe barge is believed to have carried as much as 35,000 barrels of fuel oil, Tobago's officials have said. The spill has blackened the island's beaches, affecting wildlife and tourism.\n\nSeveral beach and golf resorts in Tobago that typically receive foreign tourists have been forced to close access to the ocean. The nearby Scarborough cruise ship port is being protected from the spill by containment booms.\n\nPRIORITY\n\nTrinidad is considering declaring a Tier 3 emergency that would allow it to obtain foreign assistance to deal with the spill, Prime Minister Keith Rowley told Parliament on Friday.\n\nFirst responders and volunteers in Tobago have so far collected about 2,000 barrels of oil, but the island is short of protective equipment for volunteers and crews, TEMA said.\n\nThe Trinitarian government's next task is to empty the vessel in a controlled operation. \"The vessel is, as of now, still stuck on the reef at Cove and continues to pose a major threat as it continues to foul the coastline and surrounding seas,\" Rowley said.\n\nThe twin-island nation's government said the ship's origin was Panama and it was bound for Guyana. However, monitoring service TankerTrackers.com has said the barge-tugboat combo was seen in satellite photos near Venezuela's Puerto La Cruz refinery in late January, and it was headed to St. Vincent and Grenadines days before the spill.\n\nVenezuela's oil minister Pedro Tellechea told reporters on Friday the vessel \"has nothing to do\" with state oil company PDVSA or Venezuela, but the country is collaborating with Trinidad's investigation including the oil's type.\n\nBrazil also has offered help, Trinidad's government said. Grenada did not reply to a request for comment.",

        "title": "'The Love Boat': How a TV show transformed the cruise industry",
        "content": "From steam-powered ships, to mega-liners, the cruise industry has been through quite a transformation over the years. And the market has skyrocketed.\n\nBack in 1970, an estimated 500,000 people went on a cruise holiday. That figure had jumped to five million by 1997.\n\nSo what brought about this sudden surge in interest? According to industry experts, it was mainly down to a certain TV show with a catchy theme tune.\n\n\"Come aboard, we're expecting you!\"\n\nProduced by TV legend Aaron Spelling, \"The Love Boat\" first aired in 1977 and went on to become one of the most successful shows in TV history during its decade-long run.\n\nThe program, which is still available on streaming services such as Paramount Plus, partnered with Princess Cruises, and episodes were filmed aboard various Princess Cruise ships, the Pacific Princess and Island Princess being the most notable.\n\nBased on a non-fiction book written by former cruise director Jeraldine Saunders, \"The Love Boat\" centred around ship captain Merrill Stubing (played by Gavin MacLeod) and his on-board crew, while different guest actors played passengers each episode.\n\nThe show, which spawned several spin-offs, has since been described as \"the greatest product placement\" ever, serving as a complete introduction to cruising for many of its avid viewers.\n\n\"'The Love Boat' really created the cruise industry,\" Michael L. Grace, who worked as a scriptwriter on the program during the 1980s, told CNN Travel in 2022. \"Because you had 50 million people watching, and they all wanted to go on a cruise.\"\n\nSeveral modern cruise lines existed when the show began, including Princess, founded in 1965 with a single ship cruising to Mexico. Royal Caribbean had launched in 1968, and Carnival Cruise Line was founded in 1972.\n\nBut the cruising demographic was very different to what it is now.\n\nAlthough cruise companies were apparently keen to attract younger passengers, many people simply didn't know much about cruising, and those who did had a very specific idea of it.\n\n\"Back in the day, people would say cruising was for the nearly dead or newlywed,\" says cruise journalist Carolyn Spencer Brown, chief content officer for Cruise Media, LLC.\n\n\"So when 'The Love Boat' came on and showed people of all ages and races having fun and being lively on a cruise ship, that opened up cruising to a world that didn't really know it existed.\"\n\nEach week, tens of millions of people around the world would tune in to follow the exploits of Captain Stubing, Dr. Adam Bricker (Bernie Kopell), cruise director Julie McCoy (Lauren Tewes), bartender Isaac Washington (Ted Lange) and the captain's daughter Vicki, played by Jill Whelan, and suddenly going on a cruise soared to the top of many a wish list.\n\nThe passengers \"would come on the ship,\" Grace says of the formula for the hour-long show. \"They'd have a problem. Then the problem is solved and they all come together again. [The episodes] were like small movies.\"\n\nThe launch of \"The Love Boat\" came at a time when the vast majority of cruise ships on the water were former liners that had been converted. There were few new ships in service.\n\nHowever, this quickly changed when demand shot up thanks to the success of the show.\n\nThe show \"did so well that Princess Cruises were selling out their ships,\" cruise historian Peter Knego tells CNN Travel. \"And that led to the first boom of new cruise ship building in the early 1980s.\"\n\nThe fact that scenes from \"The Love Boat\" were occasionally filmed aboard real-life cruises, with the passengers serving as extras, only added to the appeal.\n\n\"So many cruise lines want to create experiences for you that you probably couldn't create on your own,\" notes Spencer Brown.\n\nBecoming an extra on a popular TV show \"certainly qualifies as something that doesn't happen to most people.\"\n\nKeen to strike while the iron was hot, existing cruise lines began building brand-new purpose-built cruise ships in order to cater to this fast-growing market, while new companies emerged like Celebrity Cruises, founded in 1988.\n\n\"Back then, to build new cruise ships, that was a big deal,\" says Knego.\n\nPrincess ships Pacific Princess, pictured, and Island Princess were 'the original floating stars' of 'The Love Boat.' (Everett Collection)\n\nDuring the 1980s, almost 40 new cruise ships were constructed, including Tropicale, from Carnival Cruise Lines and Royal Princess, Princess Cruises' first purpose-built cruise ship.\n\nRoyal Princess \"had new features like balconies, which were pretty rare with mainstream cruising,\" he adds.\n\nAs more cruise lines emerged and began competing with each other, cruising became more affordable, expanding the market even further.\n\n\"The Love Boat\" may also have played a part in the heavy entertainment focus we see on modern-day cruise ships.\n\nOutlandish musical performances were often featured on \"The Love Boat,\" and they proved to be a big hit with viewers.\n\nDuring one of the show's specials known as \"The Love Boat Follies,\" iconic stage and screen stars Della Reese, Ethel Merman, Carol Channing and Ann Miller sing a rendition of \"I'm The Greatest Star\" from the 1968 musical \"Funny Girl\" together.\n\n\"It was very spectacular,\" says Grace, who is working on a book about the impact of \"The Love Boat.\"\n\n\"And what was so strange is, when they would flash back to the people watching in the audience, it was like a small little club. But the stage was the size of a West End theatre.\"\n\nOff-screen, the Island Princess and its sister ship Pacific Princess, the two ships primarily used for filming towards the start of the series, held main stage production shows that became hugely popular with cruising fans.\n\nThis led to the introduction of some grand new features on cruise ships in later years.\n\n\"Princess and other cruise lines went on to build ships with state-of-the-art showrooms with huge stages, sound and lighting effects that are now standard on modern cruise ships,\" says Knego, adding that the modern atriums seen on cruise ships today can also be traced back to \"The Love Boat\" ships.\n\n\"The two deck lobbies with the grand staircase that was replicated for the studio shoots were early versions of the big atriums that are now popular features on modern cruise,\" he says.\n\n\"The Love Boat\" centred around the adventures of the crew and passengers on board a luxury cruise ship. (Everett Collection)\n\nRomance was understandably a very important factor in \"The Love Boat.\" While the relationship plots certainly kept viewers entertained, Spencer Brown stresses that this focus was also beneficial when it came to maintaining the notion that \"cruises really are quite romantic.\"\n\n\"For a long time, Princess had all sorts of enhanced amenities that were pointed to romance,\" she adds.\n\n\"They really embraced this concept all the way through. You could have a balcony, sunset dinners, and rose petals strewn on your bed. All of these lovely, romantic things.\"\n\nLong-time cruise enthusiast Judi Patterson, who met her husband Andy when he was working on board another cruise ship, P&O's SS Oriana, was a fan of \"The Love Boat,\" but says her own cruising experiences were very different to what was portrayed on screen.\n\nThe show \"bears no resemblance to reality,\" says Patterson. \"But it was fun. I don't know if people actually believe that that's what happens [on cruise ships].\n\n\"It was fun to watch and think that these things might possibly happen.\"\n\n\"The Love Boat\" reruns were still airing around the world years after its last episode, and the show's fan base has remained incredibly loyal.\n\nSpencer Brown, who also met her now husband on board a cruise ship - the couple even got engaged on a cruise - believes that the partnership between \"The Love Boat\" and Princess Cruises has been the key to its longevity.\n\n\"They truly embraced each other in a way that was really genuinely heartfelt,\" she says. \"The cast members became such a part of the cruise line, and they still are.\"\n\nPrincess Cruises often holds reunion cruises, with the actors from \"The Love Boat\" appearing as special guests.\n\nThe cruise line recently announced that Jill Whelan - now Celebrations Ambassador for Princess Cruises - Bernie Kopell, Ted Lange and Fred Grandy (who played Gopher) would be reuniting for a seven-day trip from August 31 to September 7.\n\nEzra Freeman, the bartender who appeared on the short-lived reality show \"The Real Love Boat,\" which aired on CBS in 2022, will be joining the cast for the cruise, according to a press release issued by Princess Cruises.\n\nKnego, who has attended previous reunion cruises, says that he's often struck by the strength of the fan's love for the show and its stars.\n\n\"People stand in line for hours just to get their picture taken with cast members,\" says Knego. The cast \"sign autographs and it's quite a wonderful situation to this day.\"\n\nMacLeod was a regular on the popular cruises until his death in 2021.\n\n\"People always ask us why 'The Love Boat' was so popular and I always say it's because it gave people something to dream about,\" the actor said back in 2015.\n\n\"They could dream about being out on the open seas on a cruise and discovering the world's greatest destinations, dreaming about love and of course happy endings since the shows always ended on a high note. I'm proud to have played a role in the growth of the cruise industry.\"\n\nNow a billion-dollar industry, cruising has evolved considerably since \"The Love Boat.\"\n\nThere are currently over 1,200 cruise ports across the world.\n\nMore than 100 new ships were built during the 1990s, with most of them significantly bigger than the vessels featured on the show.\n\nRoyal Caribbean's MS Sovereign of the Seas, considered to be the first mega-ship, with a passenger capacity of 2,850, took its maiden voyage in 1998, while Disney Cruise Line was established that same year.\n\nAt present, Royal Caribbean's Icon of the Seas, a 20-deck ship and a crew of 2,350, is the current record-holder for the world's biggest ship.\n\nRoyal Caribbean's Icon of the Seas is currently the world's biggest ship. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic undoubtedly devastated the cruise industry, things have bounced back considerably since then, with 14 new ships expected to enter service in 2024 alone.\n\n\"To me, the cruise industry is almost a victim of its success,\" says Knego, who runs YouTube channel MidShipCinema, which is dedicated to old and new cruise ships.\n\n\"Because the mainstream cruise ships now carry up to 5,000 people and they're absolutely massive.\n\n\"They don't have the same kind of intimacy that you had back when ships only carried 800 or maybe 1,200 people like the Love Boats.\"\n\nHowever, there are various cruise companies that offer smaller ships for those keen for a more Love Boat-style cruising experience.\n\nPatterson and her husband have taken many trips with leading small-ship cruise line Viking.\n\n\"We only travel on small ships now,\" she says, noting that it's slightly more expensive to travel on more modestly sized ships. \"We had our turn on the bigger ones.\"\n\nPacific Princess and Island Princess, the original Love Boats, have been scrapped in recent years.\n\nKnego managed to photograph the Island Princess during its final days at a scrapyard in India and was able to rescue a few of the furnishings and ornaments, including a bronze mermaid sculpture and some of the furniture from the lobby area of the ship.\n\nIn 2022, another Princess ship, the Regal Princess, took centre stage, albeit in a very different format, when it appeared in \"The Real Love Boat.\"\n\n\"It's good for the cruise industry,\" Spencer Brown said of the series at the time, noting that a reality show was \"a pretty radical reinterpretation\" from the original show.\n\nAnd the latest \"Love Boat\" themed cruise, featuring meet-and-greets, menus inspired by the show and episode screenings, will be held on board Princess Cruises' 330-meter Enchanted Princess this summer, sailing from New York to Canada and New England.\n\n\"Sailing with our fans brings us so much joy and this cruise will undoubtedly be a special reunion,\" Whelan says in a statement. \"Taking us back to where it all began - on a Princess Cruise.\"",

A record 87 ships visited the port last season.\n\nThis year's passenger numbers would represent a 37 percent increase from the approximately 120,000 visitors arriving at the port in 2023.\n\nThe first cruise ship of the season, MSC Poesia, is scheduled to arrive on April 8, approximately two and a half weeks earlier than the first port of call in 2023.\n\n\"It's pretty amazing when you think about it. [the numbers]\" said Mike Cochrane, CEO of the Charlottetown Port Authority.\n\n\"We are increasing the number of calls our ships make and increasing passenger capacity, which means larger ships are coming to our region.\"\n\nAlthough the fall months are traditionally busy for the Port of Charlottetown, Cochrane said it's \"fantastic\" to see an increase in the number of ships booked for the spring and summer.\n\nThe busiest day of the season is expected to be October 1st. Four cruise ships carrying up to 6,000 passengers are expected to arrive on the same day.\n\nBig ships mean a lot of money for Charlottetown and the province in general. Cochrane said the direct economic impact of cruises last year was about $21.5 million.\n\nFor the port authority and tourism groups and operators, it is a welcome sign that the cruise sector is thriving again after two years of shutdown due to the pandemic.\n\n\"The appetite in our region, and particularly in Charlottetown, is proof of the demand,\" he said. \"We have beautiful scenery and people, and you combine that with a very engaged tourism industry and I think you have a recipe for success.\"\n\nCochrane calls cruises \"managed tourism,\" meaning island operators can plan ahead to deliver experiences to cruise passengers efficiently.\n\n\"You know when they're coming, you know how many they're coming, you know exactly what their needs are and you know exactly when they're leaving,\" he said. \"I think that's really at the heart of how Prince Edward Island has developed as a destination.\"",

        "title": "Southwest Airlines Nearly Doubles Its Maintenance Hangar In Phoenix",
        "content": "Sustainability has been at the heart of the expansion, along with bettering the facilities of the technical workers.\n\nSummary Southwest Airlines doubles maintenance hangar in Phoenix, expanding with $100 million project. Airlines committed to sustainability with eco-friendly expansion materials and carbon emission reduction goals. Phoenix mayor and Southwest COO express gratitude for community investment and growth. SIMPLEFLYING VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nOn February 16, the largest MAX operator and the world's largest low-cost carrier, Southwest Airlines, celebrated the winding up of a $100 million project spanning several years. The project saw an expansion of 90,000 square feet, doubling Southwest's maintenance hangar at Phoenix Sky Harbor. This also allowed the airline to add three new aircraft bays to the facility.\n\nArizona and the Southwest connection\n\nSouthwest began its operations in the busiest three-runway airport in the world, Sky Harbor, in January 1982. Starting its operations with a rather humble figure of 13 daily flights, Southwest now sees 220 departures a day here. Last year, employees at Southwest volunteered more than 416 days worth their time to the causes of bettering the lives of people in Arizona.\n\nPhoto: Southwest Airlines\n\nThe expansion of the maintenance hangar at Sky Harbor means that work can be done concurrently on five aircraft. The addition of maintenance shops will result in support for the airlines' technical operations employees based at Sky Harbor. The doubling of its maintenance hangar in Phoenix also came with a more voluminous facility for employees handling ground support equipment maintenance as well as provisioning.\n\nThis paints Southwest Airlines in a good light after it had to pay $422,000 in fines last year. The penalties came after claims that the airlines retaliated against the mechanics who were using their earned sick time.\n\nRelated Southwest Airlines Facing Over $400,000 In Arizona Labor Fines The airline argued that its bargaining agreement with aircraft mechanics is subject to federal labor laws. What the airline and Phoenix's mayor had to say\n\nOn the completion of the project, The Chief Operating Officer at Southwest Airlines, Andrew Watterson, commented:\n\n\"The Safety-first work to support a continuous renewal of our fleet benefits our entire network and the community. Investing in our Arizona-based People by equipping them with the latest tools, enhanced processes, and functional spaces is one of the most impactful investments we can make at Southwest Airlines and our future in Phoenix.\"\n\nPhoto: Eliyahu Yosef Parypa | Shutterstock\n\nThe mayor of Phoenix, Kate Gallego, was buoyant that the city benefited from the extension of Southwest's operations:\n\n\"We are grateful to Southwest Airlines for believing in Phoenix and going above and beyond to plant roots in our community, whether it's through expanded operations or countless volunteer hours with local organizations. Phoenix is proud to be a major service market for Southwest and we stand ready to continue welcoming millions more passengers to the Valley of the Sun!\"\n\nPaving a way forward for sustainability\n\nSouthwest Airlines is dedicated to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and plans to cut down the intensity of its carbon emissions in half by 2035. It also expects to replace 10% of its jet fuel with sustainable aviation fuel by 2030.\n\nPhoto: Southwest Airlines\n\nThe airline's dedication to sustainability goals also trickled into the expansion of its maintenance hangar. In total, 30% of the building materials were made up of recycled content. The products used in the construction came from manufacturers that had verified environmental performance. The extended hangar also comes with a high-reflectance roof to ward off the heat island effect. The surrounding paving materials were also chosen with this effect in mind.\n\nGet all the latest aviation news for North America here.\n\nSouthwest also has a pledge to cut down the energy utilization index at its headquarters by 50% by 2035. In addition to the dedication towards sustainability it showed during this project, the airline also has set its sights on carbon removal by Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology and cooperating with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to optimize air traffic routes to achieve lower emissions.\n\nSouthwest AirlinesIATA/ICAO Code: WN/SWA Airline Type: Low-Cost Carrier Hub(s): Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, Dallas Love Field, Denver International Airport, Harry Reid International Airport, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Houston Hobby Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, Midway International Airport, Oakland International Airport, Orlando International Airport, Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport Year Founded: 1967 CEO: Robert Jordan Country: United States",

        "content": "Antarctica21 is to build a new expedition cruise ship designed exclusively for Antarctic exploration. Magellan Discoverer is scheduled to join the fleet for the 2026-2027 Antarctic season.\n\nAccording to Antarctica21, the new ship order is a response to the \"increasing demand\" for the operator's fly-and-cruise Antarctic expeditions, which enable guests to fly to Antarctica to join their ship directly, rather than sailing the rough seas of the Drake Passage.\n\nMagellan Discoverer has been designed as a sister ship to the company's existing polar expedition ship, Magellan Explorer, but will have \"numerous enhancements\".\n\nThe vessel will feature a yacht-like aesthetic and accommodate up to 76 guests in 40 cabins across three passenger decks. It will comply with the Tier III emission standard, thanks to its hybrid diesel-electric propulsion and heat recovery systems.\n\nThe accommodation has been designed to \"encapsulate the essence of adventure\", according to Antarctica21\n\nMagellan Discoverer will have 12 Suites, 22 Deluxe veranda cabins and six Single Deluxe veranda cabins, all with private balcony. In addition, it will feature a dining room, meeting rooms, an observation lounge and bar, a gym, a sauna, and a gift shop.\n\n\"This ship is born out of our unwavering commitment to meeting the rising expectations of our guests,\" said Jaime V\u00e1squez, president of Antarctica21. \"Equipped with the latest technology, Magellan Discoverer strengthens our dedication to sustainability while offering seamless comfort for our travellers. With its modern elegance and advanced technical features, it supports our ongoing effort to provide unparalleled experiences in the spectacular Antarctic region.\"\n\nThe ship will also have an onboard wet science lab to support Antarctic research programmes, and a wraparound walking deck, providing 360-degree views of the Antarctic landscapes.\n\n\"Leveraging our experience with Magellan Explorer and our fruitful collaboration with the shipbuilder Asenav, I am thrilled to embark on the Magellan Discoverer project,\" said Claudio Bobadilla, fleet director at Antarctica21. \"We are committed to innovating and setting new standards in expedition cruising. Several design enhancements have been developed, reflecting our learnings from building Magellan Explorer together. Our goal is to exceed the high standards expected by our guests. Magellan Discoverer will set a new standard of excellence in the Antarctic tourism industry, and be a point of pride for our team.\"\n\nSource: cruiseandferry.net\n\nTweet",

        "title": "Carnival Cruise Line bans a highly-requested onboard item",
        "content": "Cruise lines have a long list of items passengers can't bring onboard. That's because cruise ships face special dangers compared to land-based hotels.\n\nPassengers often don't know these rules or try to get around them because when you leave your cruise you will see a table full of confiscated items being returned. People pack everything from candles to coffee makers as well as forbidden items like bottles of alcohol.\n\nRelated: Royal Caribbean and Carnival Cruise Line passengers get a warning\n\nIn most cases, the cruise line simply removes the item from your checked bag which you learn when your bag does not make it to your room. You get a call or a note saying to come pick up your luggage where you learn what has been confiscated.\n\nUnless you try something truly illicit, like trying to hide booze in a fake shampoo bottle or attempt to bring cannabis (or any other controlled substance) onboard, cruise lines like Carnival and Royal Caribbean give passengers the benefit of the doubt that the mistake was honest.\n\nMany people don't know, for example, the cruise lines ban surge protectors. You can bring a power strip or outlet extender that does not offer surge protection, but the seemingly safer ones are not allowed because they actually increase fire risk.\n\nThe same logic applies to curling irons for your hair or irons to fix the wrinkles in your clothes. Both could cause a fire because they get very hot.\n\nMany passengers don't bother checking what's allowed, they simply search Google or Amazon for \"cruise-safe\" items. The problem is that one popular item that has popped up in ads on various cruise-related websites and Facebook groups says it's cruise-safe, but the cruise lines have not approved it.\n\nCruise ship passengers often lament not being able to bring an iron because their clothes get wrinkled being packed in a bag. It's actually a bigger issue for crew members who need to keep their uniforms looking crisp because many Royal Caribbean and Carnival Cruise Line (CCL) ships only have one or two ironing boards with working irons in the crew laundry areas.\n\nCarnival does offer a self-serve laundry option for passengers. Royal Caribbean does not, while both have laundry services where, for an added fee, you can get items pressed and/or cleaned.\n\nMany cruisers got excited when they saw ads for the Riddia Press iron from Magis Industries, Inc. In the ads, which have appeared on social media, the company calls the iron \"TSA approved\" and \"cruise ship approved.\"\n\nThe TSA, of course, has no role in regulating cruise ships and \"cruise ship approved\" doesn't actually mean anything. In theory, the company pushes that its irons are safe for use onboard because they heat up quickly and shut off automatically.\n\nThat's not how Carnival sees it, according to Brand Ambassador John Heald.\n\nHeald, who usually takes a humorous tone addressed the issue on his Facebook page. His comments were first reported by CruiseHive.\n\n\"Let me start by saying I'm sure this is a wonderful product, sold by a fabulous company. However, as people have been asking me today, I want to address this,\" The question is, has this really been approved for use on the ships?\" Heald wrote.\n\nHis answer was definitive.\n\n\"The answer is no, this is not approved by us, and I would doubt, although it's not for me to say, other cruise lines also,\" Heald added. \"We would not allow it on board and it would be confiscated.\"\n\nCarnival customers, however, don't have to resort to trying to steam their clothes in the bathroom or using wrinkle release sprays.\n\n\"Self-service launderettes are located on staterooms decks. There are 2 or 3 washers, 2 or 3 dryers, and 1 iron and ironing board in each launderette. The cost is $3.50 per washer load and $3.50 per dryer load. For your convenience, if you have not packed your own, each launderette has a vending machine that dispenses small boxes of detergent and water softener at $2 per box,\" the cruise line shared on its website.",

        "title": "'Mixed emotions' in Drogheda as rally is staged against hotel asylum plan",
        "content": "'When I said I was going to the protest, my daughter literally blanked us for the whole day,' says local woman who joined about 200 protesters\n\nAbout 200 people attended a demonstration in Drogheda, Co Louth, on Saturday to protest against a decision to house 500 asylum seekers in the local D Hotel.\n\nThe demonstration, which lasted more than two hours, was attended by a number of prominent right wing political activists from organisations including the Irish Freedom Party and the National Party. Members of the public also made contributions before the event passed off peacefully.\n\nThe 113-bedroom facility is the biggest hotel in the town and local councillors believe there will be a net loss to Drogheda of \u20ac5.4 million per year from the absence of visitors. They have also complained of a lack on consultation ahead of the decision.\n\nOn Saturday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar signalled a partial reversal of the decision, saying part of the hotel may now remain in use as a commercial premises, while other hotels in the town currently used for accommodating Ukrainian refugees may also be brought back into use.\n\nSpeaking after the protest, Dominic Carthy (50), who has lived in Drogheda for 20 years, said he had been observing the demonstration \"from a distance\".\n\nHe said: \"Most of the people there were not from the town itself. It appears as though there is a bit of a tour around the country going on, and there were no local politicians there either. It wasn't exactly representative of the town.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I don't agree with the decision on the hotel because there is massive tourism industry here. You've got the Battle of the Boyne; you've got Newgrange; there are several golf courses around; weddings happening here.\"\n\nSandra and Marina, two sisters in their 60s, said their attendance at the demonstration had caused conflict within their family.\n\n\"We were at the protest. We have mixed emotions. Obviously we don't want to come across as being racist or far right, but it is going to ruin a town that is already on its knees,\" said Sandra.\n\n\"My daughter is very much for all the refugees. When I said I was going to the protest, she literally blanked us for the whole day. She's 29. She'll get over it. She doesn't realise that I'm doing this for her. She's trying to buy a house here.\n\n\"Our young people have no homes. My son is gone to Australia. My daughter can't find anywhere to rent. She can't get a mortgage.\n\n\"I think the protest is more about how the Irish people are being treated by the Government. I agreed with a lot of it, but you can't say 'let's keep Ireland for the Irish'. If someone is here for 20 years and has integrated into the country, there is nothing wrong with that.\"\n\nPhilip Campbell (44), lives in the town but commutes to Dublin for work. He said the mood of the town was about \"50/50'' on the issue of the hotel.\n\n\"I was over at the protest earlier on just for 10 or 15 minutes,\" he said. \"I only went over because I thought it was to do with the hotel, but I didn't think it was really about that. It was just anti-immigrant. They don't want them at all. To be honest, that's not fair. A lot of Irish went to different countries and people have taken them in.\"\n\nFrank Godfrey, a former mayor of the town, said the hotel was \"one of the best things that ever happened to Drogheda\", and that there is \"a lot of anger\" in the town.\n\n\"We have busloads of visitors who come here and stay at the hotel,\" he said. \"It's an amenity that is going to be badly missed.\n\n\"I love the D Hotel. I go there for my lunch on a regular basis. I was on my way down to have a meal there and the guard stopped me and told me it was closed. We want our hotel back, and we want a couple of additional hotels. Half of Dublin is living here at the moment.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he was interrupted by a passerby. \"I was disappointed to see you at that [event] Frank,\" the woman called.\n\nAlice Sheridan (57), who works in Staffords Fine Foods, has been living and working in the town for 19 years.\n\n\"I absolutely love it here,\" she said. \"I'm originally from Dublin but I wouldn't go back for all the money in the world. It's a small town - a happy town - and it's a good community.\n\n\"We are all so annoyed. I had loads of customers in today who were on the protest. I would have been at it myself only I'm just literally walking out of work.\n\n\"Where are all the stags and hens coming from the UK going to go? Are the schools going to be overcrowded?... It's unfair. Everyone is welcome, but this is not a rich town.\"\n\nSpeaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Saturday, the Taoiseach said he understood the concerns of local people \"that losing the major hotel in their town would be a major set back in terms of what has been achieved in the town in recent years.\"\n\nMr Varadkar said he and Minister for Integration Roderic O'Gorman are exploring solutions, including the possibility that some of the hotel will remain in use for paying guests while the rest is used for asylum seekers.",

        "content": "A boutique cruise line, which offers fly-and-sail expeditions to Antarctica, is getting a third, cutting-edge ship that is designed to keep sustainability and environmental responsibility at the forefront.\n\nAntarctica21, which offers both sea voyages and fly-and-sail adventures to the White Continent during the region's summer months (October to March), is adding a new ship named Magellan Discovery, designed with the latest in environmentally friendly technology in mind.\n\nThe new vessel, which will be named Magellan Discoverer, is expected to enter service in time for the 2026-2027 Antarctic season and will be custom-built specifically for expeditions to the 7th continent. The ship will be built at the ASENAV shipyard in Valdivia, Chile, which is the same shipyard that built its sister ship, Magellan Explorer.\n\nWhile the new addition will mirror its sister ship in its yacht-esque elegance and style, what makes this new ship extra exciting is its commitment to environmental stewardship.\n\nIn addition to some other enhancements, Magellan Discoverer will feature a cutting-edge, hybrid diesel-electric propulsion system, which is not only a greener alternative to typical diesel engines, but will also help stabilize the ship to allow for smoother voyages.\n\n\"This ship is born out of our unwavering commitment to meeting the rising expectations of our guests. Equipped with the latest technology, Magellan Discoverer strengthens our dedication to sustainability while offering seamless comfort for our travelers,\" says Jaime V\u00e1squez, President of Antarctica21.\n\nMagellan Discoverer will feature two powerful MAN main engines, as well as ABB's innovative Azipod\u00ae propulsion units and Energy Storage System with the Battery Bank from Corvus.\n\nIt will meet the strict PC6 ice class specifications that are required for Polar Class ships undertaking arctic and antarctic expeditions, while also complying with the stringent Tier III emission standard - in line with the cruise industry's goal to be carbon neutral by 2050.\n\nMagellan Discoverer will be a lot like its sister ship, Magellan Explorer, which joined the Antarctica21 fleet during the 2019-2020 season.\n\nMagellan Explorer, which was also built specifically for Antarctic exploration, can accommodate 76 guests per sailing across seven different types of accommodations. The ship also features a glass-enclosed observation room for watching the ocean and marine wildlife, a gym, sauna, state-of-the-art audio-visual equipment, a dining room, and a medical clinic.\n\nLikewise, the brand new Magellan Discoverer will also have a capacity of 76 passengers across 40 cruise cabins. The offerings on board will be a lot like its sister ship, but with some enhancements, such as a stylish observation lounge and bar.\n\nThe other ship operated by Antarctica21, Ocean Nova, is older and a tad smaller, with the ability to host 67 passengers. This vessel was built in Denmark in 1992, but was refurbished in 2006 and receives yearly upgrades and improvements.\n\nRead Also: Two Cruise Ships Meet in Antarctica for the First Time\n\nThe newest addition to the fleet will join its sister ship and Ocean Nova in offering the air-cruises Antarctica21 is known for, which will be based out of the company's new expedition center, Explorer House, in Punta Arenas, Chile.\n\nThis is where cruisers will go over pre-departure briefings and have a chance to mingle with other passengers before taking a two-hour flight to King George Island, where they will embark on their cruise.\n\nPrior to Antarctica21's founding in 2003, the only way to reach the Antarctic Peninsula was via a two-day cruise across the notoriously rocky Drake Passage. Bringing air and sea into one adventure make Antarctica21's expeditions more comfortable for guests and more efficient - which is something Magellan Discoverer will soon be part of.",

        "title": "66 Countries with a Double Tax Treaty with the USA",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 66 countries with a double tax treaty with the USA. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, go to 10 Countries with a Double Tax Treaty with the USA.\n\nWe are living in an interconnected world and people migrate from one country to another for better living standards and job opportunities. One thing they can't escape is taxes. Governments run on taxes worldwide and income taxes are the most important among all the taxes, generated by individuals or businesses within their domain. In the global landscape of multinationals and startups, individuals and businesses can suffer complexities, one of which is the potential for double taxation. To circumvent paying tax on the same income twice, countries often have double taxation treaties (DTTs). The DTTs mitigate double taxation for individuals and businesses operating across borders. The United States has a tax treaty with 66 countries. The double tax treaty between the US and Hungary has been terminated, effective January 1, 2024. The US-Chile tax treaty was approved by the US Senate on June 22, 2023, effective February 1, 2024.\n\nUnder the double taxation treaties, residents of foreign countries are taxed at reduced rates or are exempt from taxes on income generated from certain items they obtain from sources within the US. The reduced rates and exemptions under the double taxation treaties vary among countries and specific items of income. There is a \"saving clause\" in most income tax treaties, which inhibits a US citizen or resident from using tax treaty provisions to prevent taxation of the US source income.\n\nCountries with the highest income tax rates in the world include Finland, Denmark, Japan, Austria, and Sweden, among others. Finland has a 56.95% personal income tax rate, and Denmark, Japan, Austria, and Sweden have personal income tax rates of 56%, 55.97%, 55%, and 52.30%, respectively. The country's tax code structure plays a vital role in its economic performance. A well-organized tax code opens the gateway for taxpayers to apply tax policies and encourage economic development through their taxes. As we mentioned earlier, marginal tax rates on individual and corporate income have declined across the OECD nations over the past few decades. Estonia continues to be the country with the best tax code for a consecutive tenth year. While, Latvia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Luxembourg, and Turkey are next that have the best tax code. The Philippines, Nicaragua, Panama, Costa Rica, and Belize, are some of the best tax free retirement countries for US citizens.\n\nThe US has been a prime location for immigrants for many years now, due to its greater job market and opportunities to become a multimillionaire. In 2024, several US states went through significant tax changes, including 16 states with income tax cuts on both individual and corporate incomes. Altogether, thirty-four US states went through notable tax changes in 2024. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has made changes to over 60 tax provisions for the tax year 2024, which will apply to income tax returns filed in 2025. For individual taxpayers and married couples with incomes greater than $609,350 and $731,200, respectively, the top tax remains unchanged at 37% for the tax year 2024. The IRS has upgraded the standard deduction to $14,600 for individual taxpayers and married individuals filing separately, up by $750 from 2023. For households, the standard deduction will be $21,900 in tax year 2024, rising by $1,100 from the tax amount charged in 2023.\n\nChina, India, Japan, Germany, and Russia are the biggest economies with a double tax treaty with the USA. In today's globalized world, businesses operate across different countries. Some of the top companies driving these economies include JD.Com Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), Infosys Limited (NYSE:INFY), and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE:MUFG).\n\nJD.Com Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) has one of the largest in-house e-commerce customer service teams in China. On February 6, JD.Com Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) reported that it is raising the annual salary for over 20,000 front-line customer service employees of the company by an average of 30%. This follows JD.Com Inc.'s (NASDAQ:JD) recent salary adjustment in December 2023, where the company almost doubled the fixed salaries of procurement and sales staff within JD Retail for 2024.\n\nInfosys Limited (NYSE:INFY) is India's leading multinational IT firm. On February 13, Infosys Limited (NYSE:INFY) announced its strategic partnership with Pacific International Lines (PIL), a leading Singapore-based shipping company. PIL will utilize Infosys Limited's (NYSE:INFY) services to accelerate its digital transformation initiative and enhance its shipping and logistics ecosystem. Global Head Retail, Consumer Goods & Logistics, Infosys Limited (NYSE:INFY), Karmesh Vaswani, said:\n\nMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE:MUFG) is one of the leading firms based out of Japan. On February 14, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc.'s (NYSE:MUFG) subsidiary, MUFG Bank, Ltd., announced that it has signed an agreement with WealthNavi Inc. (TYO:7342) on capital and business alliance. Through the capital and business alliance, MUFG Bank will subscribe to 9.11 million common stock shares of WealthNavi Inc. (TYO:7342) via a third-party allotment. This will make WealthNavi Inc. (TYO:7342) an equity method affiliate of MUFG Bank.\n\nThese were a few leading companies based out of some of the biggest economies that have a double tax treaty with the USA. Now, let's take a look at the countries with a double tax treaty with the USA.\n\nWe have gathered data for the countries with a double tax treaty with the USA from KPMG, updated as of June 30, 2023. We have corroborated the list against the IRS List of Tax Treaties database. We have ranked countries with a double tax treaty with the USA based on their GDP (PPP), as of 2024. The list is ranked in ascending order of their GDP (PPP). The data for GDP (PPP) is taken from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) database.\n\nWe have also listed the treaty withholding rates on interest and the effective date of the double tax treaty with the USA of each country. The treaty withholding rates on interest explain the specific tax rate that a country has agreed to withhold at the source when paying interest to residents of another treaty partner country. This helps prevent double taxation, where the same income is taxed in both the source country and the residence country.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using different consensus approaches, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nBarbados has a 5% treaty withholding rate on interest and the treaty's effective date is January 1, 1984. Barbados is placed 66th among the countries with a double tax treaty with the USA.\n\nIceland has a 0% treaty withholding rate on interest and the treaty's effective date is effective January 1, 2009. Iceland is ranked among the countries with a double tax treaty with the USA.\n\nMalta has a 10% treaty withholding rate on interest and the treaty's effective date is January 1, 2011. Malta has a GDP of $35.17 billion.\n\nJamaica has a GDP of $37.16 billion and a 12.5% treaty withholding rate on interest.\n\nMoldova has a GDP of $45.02 billion and a 0% treaty withholding rate on interest. Moldova's treaty with the USA became effective on January 1, 1976.\n\nTrinidad & Tobago has a 30% treaty withholding rate on interest and the treaty's effective date is effective January 1, 1970.

        "content": "Taoiseach says 15 diplomats 'should be adequate' for Russia's needs in Ireland amid concerns about espionage at Dublin embassy\n\nIreland is \"scrutinising\" every new application from Russian diplomats coming here amid concerns about espionage, T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Miche\u00e1l Martin has said.\n\nMr Martin was responding to a recent report in The Irish Times that Ireland is refusing to grant new diplomatic visas to Russia officials in an effort to reduce the size of its Dublin embassy due to concerns about spying.\n\nAs a result, the number of diplomats and administrative staff in the sprawling embassy on Orwell Road had fallen by half, from a high of 30, since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nShortly after the invasion, Ireland expelled four diplomats for engaging in espionage. Since then, it has attempted to reduce the number further by freezing visa applications from incoming officials, drawing the ire of the Russian embassy which complains they are severely understaffed.\n\n\"As you know, we took steps as a Government to reduce significantly the number of people [in the embassy], particularly those who were advised were not actually diplomats but were performing intelligence functions,\" Mr Martin said in an interview with The Irish Times on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Germany.\n\n\"So, the embassy is much, much reduced. I think it's down to 15 now because of the actions we have taken.\"\n\nThe T\u00e1naiste said Ireland \"scrutinises\" each new visa application from Russian diplomats and that Russia does the same to Irish officials.\n\n\"So, there is a degree of toing and froing on these issues. There hasn't been much movement either way since.\"\n\nHe said the Government had no issue with Russian diplomacy but that \"when we are advised by our intelligence services that other activities are under way, we take steps to make sure that's not happening\".\n\nMr Martin was attending the prestigious security conference alongside Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, making the first time an Irish head of Government has taken part in the event in its 60-year history.\n\nAsked about the embassy, Mr Varadkar said he believed 15 diplomats \"should be adequate for [Russia's] needs here.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the Taoiseach took part in a debate on neutrality alongside leaders from Austria, Malta and the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nHe rejected the claim that Ireland is freeloading on others for its defence and that it relies on the UK military for security.\n\n\"We have our own navy, though it's not as strong as it needs to be, and we've entered into agreements with Pesco [the EU Permanent Structured Cooperation defence structure] and NATO's Partnership for Peace which relate to the cables that are around the island which are important to us and important to our neighbours.\"\n\nSecurity goes beyond military spending, Mr Varadkar said. He said Ireland is one of few countries whose international aid budget is bigger than the defence budget.\n\nThis is done to increase security, he said.\n\n\"Because if we can start to remove some of those underlying causes of conflict in the world, we could have a much safer place and a much better place. Then perhaps there wouldn't be such a need for everyone to be so well armed.\"\n\nThe Taoiseach said he finds to difficult to envisage a scenario where Ireland would give up its neutrality, aside from an invasion or terrorist attack by another country.\n\n\"Often, it's our neutrality that protects us. We don't have many enemies; we have lots of friends. That's not a coincidence.\"\n\nHe said Ireland would be willing to be part of any peace process between Russia and Ukraine to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\"But I need to be very clear, should there be any peace process, we have to be guided by president [Volodymyr] Zelenskiy and the Ukrainian government on how and when that should take place.\"",

That's because four out of five NHS dental surgeries are currently not accepting new patients.\n\nLatest developments:\n\nAndrea Leadsom has praised new plans to 'cut bureaucracy'.\n\ndad\n\nA&E admissions have seen a sharp rise in dental-related admissions, including in children with cavities.\n\nHealth leaders described the entrance exam as a \"bureaucratic process\" that would lead to \"long delays\" for dentists to start treating patients.\n\nAndrea Leadsom, Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Public Health, Start of Life and Primary Care, said the plan \"will ensure the highest standards of care and patient care while cutting down on the bureaucracy that currently prevents qualified overseas dentists from working in this country\". He said. safety.\n\nBut dentists' unions have criticized the new plans, accusing the government of trying to \"fill a leaky bucket\" without addressing the real problems.\n\nThe British Dental Association (BDA) said 'recovery planning' did not live up to its title and that there was 'no evidence' that foreign dentists were more willing to work for the NHS than British dentists.\n\nDespite record numbers of dentists registered with the GDC, the number carrying out NHS work has fallen to 2016 levels.\n\nEddie Crouch, BDA chairman, said: Breach of contract is leading to dentists being kicked out of the NHS, a job that operates every day.\n\nOverseas dentists are no more likely to adhere to a failed system than their UK colleagues.
