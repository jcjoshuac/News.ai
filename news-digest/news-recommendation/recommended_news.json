        "content": "16Arlington's Marco Capaldo lives in an everlasting daydream. The 31-year-old London veteran brought life to the luxurious label alongside his late partner Federica 'Kikka' Cavenati, honoring her lively spirit since passing in 2021. Capaldo has continued to expand 16Arlington's identity with feathered frocks and shimmering undertones identified as \"it\" girl uniforms.\n\n16Arlington returned to London Fashion Week, opening the second day with a glamorously sinister Fall/Winter 2024 collection titled \"I'm Not Sorry, It's Human Nature.\" The 41-look range questions, \"What makes a monster?\" as the show notes read, \"Is it their physical freakishness? Is it their bloodlust? Or is it their status as something other than human, something abject, unnatural? Is a monster born, or are they made?\"\n\nLondon-based artist and curator Charlie Fox guided Capaldo through the collection, influenced by his 2019 title My Head is a Haunted House. His work comes to life across eerie projections that examine reality, translated into the collection that decked the halls of Barbican Centre's The Curve gallery. The circular venue was awakened by human shadows, crawling under beaming lights in the name of illusion. 16Arlington's shimmering allure stood strong, decorating evening dresses, wool coats, and fuzzy knitwear in exotic materials ranging from ostrich leather to sheer organza. An array of black looks began the collection, followed by sheer gowns headed for the alter. Knitwear clung to models' shoulders and replaced traditional tops, while awkward cuts and sparkling ornamentation discharged twilight swimmers under the sea.\n\nTake a closer look at 16Arlington's FW24 collection in the gallery above, and stay tuned for more Paris Fashion Week content on Hypebeast.",

While Fall/Winter 2024 marked Holloway's debut, Dunhill returned to the runway for the first time since 2020 -- experiencing a rebirth during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDunhill's FW24 collection was the epitome of luxury, influenced by sophistication and gentleman's coding. Holloway recalled the past while looking to the future optimistically, honoring the brand's 130-year history across several dapper looks. Dunhill welcomed guests inside London's National Portrait Gallery, shutting down the Duveen Wing inaugurated by King George V and Queen Mary in 1933.\n\nThe influential quarter was flooded with century-old portraits of affluent Brits, hosting a luxurious tea service with petite finger sandwiches and boozy dirty martinis. Models walked through the corridors in crisp tailoring that transitions from day to night, pulling inspiration from the 1970s uniforms of Truman Capote and Frank Sinatra. Timeless Hollywood wardrobes reigned supreme, cementing Dunhill's stance as a unique luxury House.\n\nBespoke suits and leather goods walked the runway with layering in mind, opening the showcase with a three-piece grey ensemble, a coordinating necktie, and racing leather gloves. Collarless outerwear and knitted mock necks were paired with pleated trousers and double-breasted details, heading into winter with shearling coats and striped accessories. Polka-dotted prints jumped from button-down shirts to pocket squares while velour eveningwear shimmered alongside reshaped dinner jackets and silk bowties.\n\nTake a closer look at Dunhill's FW24 collection in the gallery above, and stay tuned for more London Fashion Week content on Hypebeast.",

Aksu showcased his usual lace dresses, some with puffy sleeves. His designs came in cream, taupe, blue and grey, with some dabs of pink. There was plenty of colour at Mark Fast's show, where models wore bright knits with oversized coats, crochet or fringed tops and dresses as well as jeans that morphed into denim boots.\n\nThe vibrant collection, called \"Galaxy Beyond\", featured outfits in fuchsia, orange, purple, blue, chartreuse and black paired with shiny black boots or silver footwear. London Fashion Week runs until Feb. 20, with the likes of Burberry, Erdem and Di Petsa also on the calendar.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "title": "Jennifer Lopez, Zendaya, Bad Bunny and Chris Hemsworth will host the Met Gala under the theme 'The Garden of Time'",
        "content": "Anna Wintour, the head of Vogue magazine, released two pieces of news on Thursday morning, both in connection with the high-profile Met Gala, which will take place on May 6 at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. With less than three months to go, Wintour has finally explained what this year's dress code will be: \"The Garden of Time.\" On the other hand, the editor-in-chief has revealed the names of the event's co-chairs: two men and two women, all of them celebrities in their own right in the world of entertainment. They will be the singers and actresses Jennifer Lopez and Zendaya, who have become style icons in recent years, the Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny, and the Australian actor Chris Hemsworth, known for his role as Thor. They will join honorary chairs Jonathan Anderson, creative director of the Loewe brand, and Shou Zi Chew, CEO of the TikTok platform.\n\nThe theme of the party is in line with the spring exhibition to be held at the museum. The gala takes place on the first Monday in May every year, and right afterwards, a fashion exhibition opens to review an era, a designer, a trend or an idea. This year, the exhibition will be called Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion. In 2023, both the exhibition and the gala revolved around the late couturier Karl Lagerfeld, head of houses such as Chanel and Fendi, and the hosts were the actresses Michaela Coel and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, the tennis player Roger Federer and the singer Dua Lipa. This year, these Sleeping Beauties will showcase very delicate garments, so fragile that they must be stored in special glass cases, as the curators of the exhibition explained a few months ago.\n\n\"The exhibition will breathe new life into these storied objects through creative and immersive activations designed to convey the smells, sounds, textures, and motions of garments that can no longer directly interact with the body,\" the museum explained in a statement. There will be three sub-themes: land, sea and air. Up to 250 garments and accessories from the last 400 years that have barely been seen until now will be on display in the museum, including an English Elizabethan bodice from the 17th century, which will be on display from May 10 to September 2.\n\nVogue has announced the four hosts and the theme with a video on social media that simulates a conversation between the four and Anna Wintour through text messages. It is Wintour who provides guidance about the dress code thanks to a painting uploaded by Jennifer Lopez: The Old Gateway, by the British artist Thomas Edwin Mostyn (1864-1930), depicting a Victorian garden with romantic and 19th-century touches. The dress code for the gala is based on the story The Voices of Time, published in 1962 by the writer J. G. Ballard (the same author of Empire of the Sun, which Steven Spielberg brought to the screen in 1987).\n\nTherefore, the entire wardrobe will contain elements of gardens, crystals, melancholy and a \"modern dystopia.\" The magazine uses current examples of garments by designers such as Giambattista Valli, Valentino, Loewe and Simone Rocha, and also by Karl Lagerfeld and Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, although remembering that \"the spirit of the exhibition focuses on the passage of time.\"\n\nAs for the hosts, their role will be to accompany Wintour and receive the rest of the hundreds of guests who will parade on the red carpet of the New York museum. Of the four, the one who has drawn the most attention is Chris Hemsworth, as he does not have as direct a connection with the world of fashion as the other three, and in fact this will be his first time at the gala (it is possible that he will be accompanied by his wife, Elsa Pataky). New Yorker Jennifer Lopez, 54, and Californian Zendaya, 27, have become fashion icons, especially in recent years. Belonging to two very different generations, both stand out for always being among the best dressed, in addition to being lovers of design; it's not unusual to see them in fashion shows and catwalks. Lopez, recognized as a Fashion Icon by the Council of Fashion Designers of the United States in 2019, has attended the event up to 13 times, with designs by Valentino, McQueen, Marchesa and Dolce&Gabbana. Last year she wore a Ralph Lauren, with a huge black train and a Philip Treacy headdress. Zendaya, who received the same tribute as a Fashion Icon by the Council in 2021, has attended five galas, including one in which she dressed as Cinderella and another as a modern Joan of Arc. The Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny, 29 years old and whose real name is Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio, is also one of the most groundbreaking men in terms of fashion, and this will be his third gala.",

The foursome will follow on the heels of last year's co-hosts: Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Michaela Coel, Roger Federer, and Dua Lipa.\n\nThe theme is inspired by the Costume Institute's exhibition being unveiled that evening, entitled Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion. The exhibit is set to include a body of clothing and fashion considered so fragile that it can't be worn again, thus the name.\n\nAs for the evening's dress code, guests will be encouraged to wear pieces that embody \"fleeting beauty.\" \"Melancholic florals\" are mentioned in the official release; the theme also suggests environmentally-conscious designers could come into play.\n\nThe guest list for the evening is kept under close wraps. With Met Gala highlights Zendaya and Jennifer Lopez confirmed as co-hosts, viewers are in an evening of couture like never before. TikTok is co-hosting the event, suggesting some fresh new faces will arrive on the carpet.\n\nNow back to the exhibit itself. According to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the fashion archives presented will date back to the 17th-century Elizabethan era and will be separated into three sub-themes for visitors to explore: Land, Sea, and Sky.\n\nThe exhibit will include an array of modern designers, from Stella McCartney to Loewe, along with the likes of Elsa Schiaparelli, Yves Saint Laurent, Christian Dior, and Hubert de Givenchy.\n\nWith several weeks between now and the first Monday in May, there's time to fantasize about who will join the co-chairs on the Met steps. (Rihanna is at the top of the wish list.)",

The much-anticipated day belongs to the annual Met Gala, which celebrates the opening of the Costume Institute's latest exhibition inside The Metropolitan Museum of Art. On Thursday, Vogue officially confirmed details for the theme and co-chairs attached to the upcoming stylish evening.\n\nThe official dress code for the 2024 Met Gala is \"The Garden of Time,\" which is inspired by J.G. Ballard's 1962 short story of the same moniker that \"can be interpreted in a myriad of ways,\" per the outlet. Given the name, the heavily-dissected looks will likely cite floral and environmental mood boards.\n\nThis year's hosts include Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny, Chris Hemsworth and Anna Wintour. The group will follow last year's anchors, which included Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Michaela Coel, Roger Federer, Dua Lipa and Wintour. Notably, Wintour has spearheaded the Gala since 1995.\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala will cut the ribbon on Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion, a showcase that will include roughly 250 garments from the Costume Institute's permanent collection, many of which have not ever been viewed publicly.\n\nSpanning 400 years of fashion history, the exhibition will include pieces from contemporary fashioners such as Phillip Lim, Stella McCartney and Connor Ives, among others, as well as canonical designers like Elsa Schiaparelli, Yves Saint Laurent, Christian Dior and Hubert de Givenchy.\n\nThe exhibition will center 50 delicate, historical garments that cannot be worn again, hence the name \"Sleeping Beauties.\" Among them, Charles Frederick Worth's 1877 silk satin ballgown and a 17th-century bodice will be on display, across three main zones -- Land, Sea and Sky - that chronicle the historical transformations of natural materials for fashion design.",
