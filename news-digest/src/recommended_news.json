Officially licensed by The Pok\u00e9mon Company International, this squishmallow is ready to be pre-ordered for release on March 4th, 2024.\n\n$45 at GameStop\n\nChoosing the Best Accessories for Pokemon Day\n\nObviously, Pok\u00e9mon has released a ton of accessories. With options ranging from competitive fight pads to super cute jewelry, it can be difficult to focus on what a player wants or needs the most. Here are a few tips to ensure that players' Pok\u00e9mon accessories are the best!\n\nLicensing: Nintendo and the Pok\u00e9mon Company have officially licensed products through numerous partnerships, from PowerA to Gucci. Although there are many third-party products available, the quality is not guaranteed, so buyers should carefully examine the details of any Pok\u00e9mon product that can't be returned or exchanged easily.\n\nUsefulness: Sure, having cute Pok\u00e9mon stuff is awesome, but it'd be great if the money spent on these accessories leads to another benefit besides style. Controllers, protective cases, and bags offer high usability and are therefore a better value overall.\n\nDesign: Everyone familiar with the Pok\u00e9mon Contests knows that cutesy Pikachu isn't always the winning look. Players who prefer their Pok\u00e9mon to be cool, beautiful, clever, or tough over cute should choose a design that matches their vibe. While certain Pok\u00e9mon are used in designs much more often than others, players can still find accessories that match their aesthetic. Darker colors tend to give off a cool or tough look; light colors are usually used with cute and beautiful accessories; minimalist designs, on the other hand, are perfect for clever and tough Pok\u00e9mon styles.\n\nBest Budget Pokemon Accessory\n\nJazwares Pokemon Psyduck 3.5-in Clip-On Plush\n\nEven though some Pokemon accessories are priced for millionaires, there are tons of extremely affordable options too. The Psyduck Clip-On Plush from Jazwares is perfect for anyone who enjoyed 2023's cozy smash-hit, Pokemon Concierge. The clip is wide enough to fit onto most keychains and backpacks, while its muted gray color seamlessly melds with any style. A small Pokeball indentation shows off the fact that this is officially licensed Pokemon merchandise.\n\nOf course, there are tons of different Pok\u00e9mon plushies and Squishmallows to choose from, but many of those sell out quickly and cost almost as much as a full Pok\u00e9mon game. This adorable clip on Psyduck has the yellow Pok\u00e9mon in their classic, headache stance, complete with soft fabric fur and cute, round eyes. This keychain makes a great gift for any Pok\u00e9-friends and costs less than $10.\n\nBest Premium Pokemon Accessory\n\nFujifilm Instax Mini Link Smartphone Printer Bundle Special Edition\n\nThe fanciest fans of Pok\u00e9mon will have little excuse to pass up this premium accessory, especially if they want to capture all the exciting moments of Pok\u00e9mon Day. This smartphone printer is perfect for making physical copies of pictures taken with any Bluetooth device that supports the Instax app. That app also comes with a special Switch Direct Print mode, which allows players to print out their favorite in-game shots from Pok\u00e9mon Snap or any other Nintendo title!\n\nWhile this version of the Instax Mini comes at a slight premium over the standard, it also includes a super cute Pikachu cover made with silicone, providing extra protection when running around for Pok\u00e9mon Go. Despite its high price, the Pikachu edition of the Fujifilm Instax Mini is a top-of-the-line accessory for Pok\u00e9mon fans who love capturing and sharing adventures.\n\nEditor's Choice Pokemon Accessory\n\nPokemon Pikachu Kanji Adult Black Backpack\n\nThis hardcore-looking Pok\u00e9mon backpack is perfect for adults who can't wait to head out on Pok\u00e9mon Day to enjoy the various events in their region. The sleek black bag uses a classic manga-style snapshot of Pikachu, complete with Japanese Kanji and a slick outlined Pok\u00e9mon logo. Avid Pika fans will also notice that the tail is partially obscured, making the displayed Pikachu gender-neutral (in a Schr\u00f6dinger's cat kind of way).\n\nThe bag isn't just stylish, it's fairly useful too. There's a broad laptop pocket inside the bag, plus a smaller file pocket and the main section. Adjustable straps and a partial mesh back make the bag very comfortable to travel with. Plus, the durable polyester and PU materials make the bag easy to clean with a simple cleaning cloth. It's a bit expensive compared to some of the other items on this list, but against other laptop bags, the price is almost perfectly mid-range.\n\nMore 6 Amazon Finds for a Pokemon Themed Gaming Room Pokemon fans have lots of options when it comes to decor, but these finds are absolutely perfect for a Pokemon game room!",

        "content": "What happened this week? ChatGPT maker OpenAI is wowing (and worrying) video creators with Sora (see the videos below), Xbox games are coming to PS5, we review the $500 OnePlus 12R, and new hardware is on the horizon: Sony's PSP 2 and PS6.\n\nMaybe I'm dating myself here, but Microsoft had this week's bombshell news with the biggest video game crossover since Sega started making games for Nintendo and Sony consoles in 2001. Xbox games will come to rival Sony and Nintendo consoles!\n\nIt doesn't mean Xbox is dead - in fact, execs teased a powerful new Xbox, but their 'Xbox Everywhere' strategy emphasizes software and subscriptions over hardware. Why? Sony's PS5 is now outselling Xbox at a 3:1 ratio, while Microsoft is dumping hundreds of millions of dollars into the development of triple-A games and spent billions buying Activision Blizzard. It needs access to more gamers.\n\nFriend of The Shortcut Jack McDade just launched his Radical Design Course. He's one of the best web designers out there, and I'm going through his course now.\n\nI've been following Jack's work for years. He created the post-WordPress-era CMS Statamic and designed Laravel.com among many other fresh-looking websites. Upon a desperate cold call outreach from me late last year, Jack used his proven expertise to evaluate a new web design and CMS I was having built for The Shortcut, and helped me log all of the broken pages and document all of the errors. \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\ude4f\n\nHis approach is the exact opposite of a \"website in a can.\" Check it out!\n\nMicrosoft announced that four Xbox-exclusive games are coming to rival platforms. It didn't disclose the titles in question, but it's strongly believed that the games will be:\n\nNOT coming to PS5 yet? \ud83e\uddd1\ud83d\ude80 Starfield and \ud83e\udd20 Indiana Jones. But Microsoft is looking for ways to maximize its revenue from its recent multi-billion dollar acquisition of Bethesda and Activision Blizzard by putting older titles (read: exclusive to Xbox for one year) on rival platforms. So expect more Xbox games to jump ship in the future.\n\nRead more\n\nWhile we wait patiently for the next PlayStation Portal restock, new rumors are circulating that Sony might be working on a true successor to the PSP and PS Vita. A new PlayStation Portable is reportedly in the works and will be powered by an AMD APU, similar to those found in the Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go.\n\nDemand for a new PlayStation handheld that can run games natively seems to be high, judging by the sales of the PlayStation Portal. However, the PSP 2 is at least two years out and still in the high-level design phase. There's also an argument that a PSP 2 doesn't make sense for PlayStation right now.\n\nFind out more\n\nOpenAI, the makers of the ChatGPT chatbot and DALL-E text-to-image generator, just showed off Sora, its next groundbreaking AI generative marvel. This text-to-video model can create complex videos (up to 60 seconds) using simple text prompts. The completely synthetic videos show detailed scenes, complex camera motions and multiple characters with vibrant emotions.\n\nWhile not perfect (AI still can't get human hands quite right if you look closely), it's so much more realistic than the generative videos we saw last year. Actors, camera crews, video editors and stock footage services should all be as worried - just like journalists and media publishers when ChatGPT 3.5 launched 14 months ago. But the bigger concern may be AI-generated deepfakes using this technology.\n\nSay hello our OnePlus 12R review from Max Buondonno. It's OnePlus' latest \"flagship killer\" smartphone that promises to deliver a high-end experience for an affordable price. At $499, the phone offers about 80% of the experience you'll find with the superb OnePlus 12, and side by side, these phones don't feel all that different.\n\nYes, some downsides are hard to ignore, there's no denying that the OnePlus 12R is one of the best phones you can get for under $500, and it's likely it'll stay that way throughout 2024.\n\nPros\n\nAmazon's recent decision to include adverts unless you pay an extra $2.99 a month hasn't gone down well with consumers - and it's now facing a class action lawsuit.\n\nAn Amazon Prime subscriber from California argues that Amazon has \"changed the deal\" by asking customers to pay to remove adverts, as people \"purchased and renewed their Amazon Prime subscription believing that they would include ad-free streaming\".\n\nAmazon also quietly removed Dolby Vision and Atmos support from the new ad tier for Prime Video, which again could be argued was not part of the original contract many signed up for.\n\nFind out more\n\nApple has fixed a Vision Pro headset flaw if you're the type of person who creates a password and instantly forgets it. A new update will let you reset your Apple Vision Pro at home if you accidentally pinch-click the wrong passcode too many times.\n\nPreviously, if you locked yourself out you'd have to return your headset to an Apple store or mail it to AppleCare so it could be erased or reset. Thankfully, the new visionOS 1.0.03 update solves this headache and also brings with it a few bug fixes.\n\nRead more\n\nYou no longer need an invite to access Bluesky, a decentralized alternative to Elon Musk's X that's backed by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey. It claims to have added over one million new users with this move, but it could be a sudden surge-with-no-follow-through like we saw with the initial Instagram Threads launch.\n\nEven though Bluesky is essentially a Twitter clone, its unique selling point is that it's powered by different providers instead of a centralized hub. You can pick from a variety of hosting providers, which might appeal to those who don't like the idea of their social media being run by this billionaire or that billionaire.\n\nPro tip: With all social media platforms, we suggest registering your username before it gets taken. But the chance of this one taking off? Unlikely.\n\nAmid the rise of AI imagery and video tools like Sora, Meta has said companies must disclose AI fakes across Instagram, Threads and Facebook. Those who upload realistic AI videos or audio, such as deep fakes, will also be punished if it is not disclosed that AI has been used.\n\nNick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs, said on the company's website: \"For those who are worried about video, audio content being designed to materially deceive the public on a matter of political importance in the run-up to the election, we're going to be pretty vigilant\".\n\nA new Nintendo Switch 2 leak says that Nintendo's next console will be backward compatible, which is great news for those who have amassed a large library of Nintendo Switch games over the years.\n\nThe leak comes from Universo Nintendo, a Portuguese site that also predicted that the Nintendo Switch 2 will be revealed next month, although new rumors have just emerged claiming it's been delayed to 2025. Regardless, Universo Nintendo says that Switch 2 will be backward compatible with physical and digital titles\n\nWhat's more, developers will also be able to enhance existing Nintendo Switch games to take advantage of the console's more powerful specs, similar to how we saw PS5 and Xbox Series X updates for PS4 and Xbox One games on Sony and Microsoft's consoles.\n\nFind out more\n\nYou've probably heard of the phrase \"Simpsons did it,\" a phenomenon where the writers of the long-running animation series have an uncanny habit of predicting the future. After showing Donald Trump as president in 2015 and correctly predicting the winners of Super Bowl XXIX, The Simpsons is back in the spotlight thanks to the Apple Vision Pro.\n\nIn The Simpsons episode \"Friends and Family,\" citizens of the fictional city of Springfield are seen walking around wearing virtual reality headsets. That eerie vision of the future, which aired eight years ago, has recently come true as people have taken to the streets wearing their new Apple Vision Pro headsets.",

        "title": "OnePlus Buds 3 review: It gets a lot of things right for the price",
        "content": "Readers like you help support XDA Developers. When you make a purchase using links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Read More.\n\nThe new $100 OnePlus Buds 3 is a solid pair of earbuds for the company that's very easy to recommend, in my opinion. From great audio quality and noise canceling to good fit-and-finish and commendable battery life, there is a lot of value packaged here for what is a very reasonable asking price. It's not the only set of true wireless earbuds out in this price range, but they stack up very well against the competition and leave very little room to complain about.\n\nOnePlus Buds 3 Great earbuds for $100\n\nCan't go wrong with these for $100\n\n7.5/ 10\n\nYou'll love the OnePlus Buds 3 earbuds for their audio quality, design, and particularly battery life. It also offers other features like ANC, Fast Pair, multipoint, and more for just $100, making it an easy recommendation.\n\nProsGreat audio qualityGood design and build qualityReliable battery life ConsNo wireless chargingANC could've been better $100 at Amazon$100 at OnePlus\n\nPricing, availability, and specs\n\nThe OnePlus Buds 3 earbuds debuted alongside the new OnePlus 12 and OnePlus 12R on January 23, 2024. They're readily available to purchase in the U.S. now via the official OnePlus web store and a bunch of other retailers, like Amazon. It's priced at $100, which means it goes head-to-head with the likes of Samsung Galaxy Buds FE. You can grab the OnePlus Buds 3 earbuds in Splendid Blue and Metallic Gray colors.\n\nRelated Samsung Galaxy Buds FE review: Mid-range earbuds finally worthy of the fan label This is the first Samsung Fan Edition product that doesn't feel severely watered down Specifications\n\nBattery Life Up to 6.5 hours with ANC On; additional 28 with case Charging Case Included? Yes Microphones 3x per bud Supported codecs AAC, SBC, LHDC 5.0 Price $100 IP Rating IP55 Driver Size 10.4 mm woofer + 6 mm tweeter Charging type USB-C Dimensions and weight (earbuds) 31.7 x 20.2 x 24.4 mm Dimensions and weight (case) 58.7 x 50.2 x 25.8 mm Colors Splendid Blue, Metallic Gray Noise Cancellation Yes Earbud weight 4.8 g (each) Charging case weight 40.8 g\n\nWhat I like\n\nLightweight design and great features\n\nClose\n\nOnePlus hasn't changed the design of its earbuds in a while, but I'd say that's a good thing because the OnePlus Buds 3 are just as lightweight and comfortable as the Buds Pro 2 earbuds from last year. In fact, they look identical to each other, and the one way to tell them apart is by looking at the control strip that lets you adjust the volume. I remember my colleague Ben highlighting the lack of these controls on the OnePlus Buds Pro 2 as a glaring omission last year, and I am happy to see it being taken care of this time around.\n\nThe OnePlus Buds 3 are just as lightweight and comfortable as the Buds Pro 2 earbuds from last year.\n\nIn addition to its sleek design, I also like that these earbuds come with a respectable array of features. These earbuds, in case you are wondering, are compatible with Bluetooth 5.3 and support the AAC, LHDC 5.0, and SBC codecs. Notably, you also get support for Google Fast Pair and multipoint pairing, making it extremely convenient to use them daily. The HeyMelody app also deserves a special shoutout for packing additional rich features like Golden Sound, which determines your hearing and creates a custom EQ profile specifically for your ears.\n\nGood audio quality for the price\n\nThe OnePlus Buds 3 earbuds cost $100, and they sound great compared to other earbuds that cost around the same price. Granted, you won't get the same sound quality that you'll get with the likes of the Sony WF-1000XM5 and the Sennheiser Momentum TW 3, which rank high up on our list of the best wireless earbuds on the market in 2024, but these earbuds generally sound great for the asking price.\n\nRelated Sony WF-1000XM5 review: The right kind of downsizing Sony's new earbuds shed 25% of mass compared to the last generation but somehow improved audio performance while keeping the same battery life. Bravo!\n\nYou'll have an enjoyable listening experience with these earbuds.\n\nI spent most of my time testing these earbuds with Apple Music's Lossless audio with the high-bitrate LHDC codec, and the 10.4mm woofer + 6mm tweeter setup delivered a fairly balanced sound signature. They have punchy and fast-attacking bass that don't bleed into the lower mids. There's plenty of details in the high end, too, and these earbuds also have pretty good soundstage and imaging. I suggest playing with the EQ in the HeyMelody app to find a good and comfortable setting for the kind of music you listen to, and you'll have an enjoyable listening experience with these earbuds.\n\nReliable battery life\n\nA quick look at OnePlus' website will give you a rather comprehensive list of battery life figures. I'll save you the hassle of going through all those numbers by simply saying that the OnePlus Buds 3 earbuds offer good battery life, both with and without ANC. The 58mAh battery in each earbud lasted me approximately 7 hours while testing with ANC enabled using AAC. Those numbers dropped by a bit while streaming high-quality LHDC 5.0 with ANC enabled, as they only lasted me about six hours.\n\nThese earbuds are pretty good and reliable when it comes to battery life.\n\nYou can easily get upwards of 10 hours of battery life when using OnePlus Buds 3 earbuds with ANC off, so I'd say these earbuds are pretty good and reliable when it comes to battery life. It is true that there are other earbuds out there with relatively longer battery life, but I was quite satisfied with getting through a full working day with a combination of ANC on and off playback. In fact, I'd say you can get through even a full workday with ANC enabled, provided you drop them in the case for quick top-ups in between. The included charging case, by the way, holds three additional charges worth of power, which is also great.\n\nWhat I don't like\n\nNo wireless charging\n\nThe lack of wireless charging isn't necessarily a deal-breaker, but it's definitely something to consider if you are shopping for a pair of wireless earbuds in 2024. It particularly sticks out like a sore thumb when you consider the fact that both the OnePlus Buds Pro and the OnePlus Buds Pro 2 earbuds had support for wireless charging. In fact, the OnePlus Buds Pro 2 earbuds can be had for just $125 right now, which is a great price for it. I highly recommend considering that as well if you are looking for a slightly more premium pair of earbuds with additional features.\n\nRelated OnePlus Buds Pro 2 review: Great sound and looks, but lacking ANC OnePlus' new earbuds brings all the features a modern set of wireless earbuds should, but is it enough to challenge the likes of the AirPods Pro?\n\nNoise canceling isn't strong\n\nActive noise canceling has become a fairly standard feature in this price range, so I am glad the Buds 3 earbuds deliver on that front, too. There is, however, nothing to write home about the noise-canceling you get with these earbuds. It's not entirely surprising, considering the Buds 2 Pro earbuds also had middling ANC, but a part of me wished the overall quality of ANC improved at least by a slight margin.\n\nThe OnePlus Buds 3's noise canceling isn't particularly strong, and I could definitely hear the chattering of people when I was working out of a coffee shop while using these earbuds. There is an option to adjust the ANC on these earbuds via the app, but even the highest setting wasn't fully able to eliminate all the noise. You really have to crank the volume up to be able to suppress the noise, so keep that in mind.\n\nShould you buy the OnePlus Buds 3 earbuds?\n\nYou should buy the OnePlus Buds 3 earbuds if:\n\nYou are looking for a pair of wireless earbuds with good audio and battery life. You are looking to buy a pair of earbuds that's lightweight and comfortable to wear. You only have $100 to spend on a pair of wireless earbuds.\n\nYou shouldn't buy the OnePlus Buds 3 earbuds if:\n\nYou are looking for the best audio quality for a no-compromise listening experience. You really want a strong ANC to suppress all the ambient noise. You can afford to spend more money.\n\nIt delivers good audio and lasts for a long time while doing so, which are two of the hallmark features that make it an easy recommendation.\n\nThe OnePlus Buds 3 earbuds stand as a solid choice for those who are looking to buy a pair of wireless earbuds under $100. It may not be competing with the top dogs in the category with its feature set, but it delivers good audio and lasts for a long time while doing so, which are two of the hallmark features that make it an easy recommendation over plenty of other options. The ANC could have been better, but I like the fact that it's lightweight and comfortable to wear for long periods, and it also has a good set of features like multi-point connectivity and Fast Pair that make it very convenient to use.\n\nOnePlus Buds 3\n\nGet this if you only have $100 to spend on a pair of wireless earbuds right now. These earbuds sound great for the price and they also have pretty good battery life.\n\n$100 at Amazon$100 at OnePlus",

        "title": "Can You Remove Microsoft Edge From Windows (and Should You)?",
        "content": "Readers like you help support How-To Geek. When you make a purchase using links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Read More. Quick LinksCan You Uninstall Microsoft Edge? Alternatives to Uninstalling Microsoft Edge Stop Microsoft Edge From Running in the Background Key Takeaways Microsoft Edge is deeply integrated into Windows, making it impossible to uninstall. Microsoft strongly advises against removing it. Instead of uninstalling Edge, you can set a different browser as the default and unpin Microsoft Edge from the taskbar (right-click on its icon and select \"Unpin From Taskbar\") and Start menu (Right-click on its icon and select \"Unpin From Start\"). If you're bothered by excessive resource consumption by background Edge processes, open Edge, go to Settings > System and Performance, and turn off the option to run background extensions and apps when Edge is closed.\n\nMicrosoft Edge comes preinstalled on Windows, and you cannot uninstall it like other applications. But do you really need to remove it? We'll clarify why removing Edge isn't possible and advisable on Windows. We'll also explain how to hide it from your view and stop it from running in the background.\n\nCan You Uninstall Microsoft Edge?\n\nThe simple answer is \"No.\" We've tested several methods that used to work for uninstalling Microsoft Edge, but they no longer do. None of the currently available workarounds can remove the browser. Also, Microsoft discourages users from uninstalling Microsoft Edge intentionally to avoid potential compatibility, compliance, accessibility, and performance issues.\n\nThe company explicitly states that Microsoft Edge is an integral part of the operating system and deeply embedded, meaning some apps and features rely on it to work. As per the comment of an independent advisor on a Microsoft Community thread, removing the browser may lead to issues with built-in programs such as the Photos app, the Media Player, and File Explorer.\n\nConsidering the potential consequences of uninstalling Edge on Windows features and apps and Microsoft's warning against doing so, we recommend you refrain from uninstalling it. Instead, make a few adjustments to avoid encountering Microsoft Edge in your Windows experience.\n\nAlthough third-party applications can remove the browser forcibly, we don't recommend using them due to associated privacy and security risks. Even if you delete it, Windows Update may automatically install Edge later anyway.\n\nAlternatives to Uninstalling Microsoft Edge\n\nIf you prefer external links, applications, and other items to open in a different browser, you can easily designate your preferred browser as the default instead of Microsoft Edge.\n\nIf Microsoft Edge is currently the only web browser installed on your device, download another browser, such as Chrome. To do so, visit the Google website, click the \"Download Chrome\" button, run the setup file, and follow the on-screen instructions.\n\nOnce downloaded, you can set Chrome as the default browser. Right-click on the Start button and open \"Settings.\" Then, navigate to Apps > Default Apps.\n\nThen, type \"Chrome\" in the search box below \"Set Defaults for Applications,\" and select \"Chrome.\"\n\nFinally, click \"Set Default.\"\n\nLikewise, if you prefer not to see Microsoft Edge in the taskbar and Start menu, you can easily hide it from there. To remove it from the taskbar, right-click the Microsoft Edge icon and select \"Unpin From Taskbar.\"\n\nTo hide Microsoft Edge from the Start menu, right-click on its icon and select \"Unpin From Start.\" You can also hide it from any other location where you prefer not to see it.\n\nBy following these steps, you achieve a similar outcome to uninstalling Microsoft Edge; it won't be used as the default web browser and will stay out of sight. But what if you're annoyed by the browser draining hefty system resources?\n\nStop Microsoft Edge From Running in the Background\n\nIf your concern lies in Microsoft Edge consuming considerable system resources, particularly RAM, while running in the background, you can quickly stop it.\n\nFirst, open Microsoft Edge and click the three horizontal dots in the top-right corner. From there, select \"Settings.\" In the Settings menu, navigate to the \"System and Performance\" tab on the left. Within this tab, uncheck the toggle next to \"Continue running background extensions and apps when Microsoft Edge is closed.\"\n\nAfter making these changes, close the browser and restart your device. Then, only the Microsoft Edge Update process will run in the background, which consumes negligible resources.\n\nThat's how you can effectively keep Microsoft Edge out of sight and reduce its resource consumption. That way you don't have to forcibly uninstall it and risk disrupting essential Windows services.",

        "title": "Nvidia GeForce RTX 5000 series: All of the rumors so far",
        "content": "Interested in the new Blackwell GPUs? Here's everything you need to know about them\n\nReaders like you help support XDA Developers. When you make a purchase using links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Read More.\n\nWith Intel joining the GPU race with its Arc series, there's a lot of competition in the graphics card industry. Nevertheless, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4000 series still has some of the best GPUs that money can buy. From enhancing the ray-tracing capabilities to improving in-game FPS using a combination of DLSS 3.5 and frame generation, the Ada Lovelace GPUs are a fantastic addition to the RTX branding, and you can expect this trend to continue with the upcoming GeForce RTX 5000 graphics cards.\n\nNamed \"Blackwell\" after the Mathematician David Blackwell, the new graphics cards from Team Green are rumored to bring high-bandwidth GDDR7 memory, MCM design, and other features to the table. In this article, we'll recap all the rumors and leaks about the GeForce RTX 5000 family,\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5000 series: When we're hoping to see it, and how much we want to pay\n\nNvidia tends to follow a 2-year release cycle for consumer graphics cards, with a refresh of the present-gen hardware around the one-year mark. Since Team Green debuted the Super variants of its current RTX 4000 GPUs in January 2024, we believe the Blackwell series will be unveiled between late 2024 and early 2025.\n\nEarlier, HardwareLUXX, a German tech website, reported that we won't see the \"Ada Lovelace-Next\" graphics cards before 2025. On the other hand, Youtuber Moore's Law Is Dead claimed that the newer cards could drop as early as Q4 2024. According to the leaker who tipped them off, the release window of the new series hinges on the sales of the RTX 4000 lineup and competition from AMD's upcoming RDNA 4 series GPUs. Either way, if Nvidia ends up announcing the top-of-the-line RTX 5090 by CES 2025, we could see low and mid-range RTX 5000 GPUs before the end of the year.\n\nMeanwhile, the pricing for the new graphics cards is anybody's guess. The RTX series is notorious for being overpriced, and the exorbitant pricing trends are expected to continue with the Blackwell family. Assuming we'll have an RTX 5090 instead of a 5090 Ti as the flagship GPU, it should bear the same (or slightly higher) launch price of $1,599 as the current-gen GeForce RTX 4090.\n\nSpecs\n\nRTX 5090\n\nRTX 4090\n\nInterface\n\nPCIe 5.0 x16\n\nPCIe 4.0 x16\n\nMemory\n\nX GB (possibly 24GB) GDDR7\n\n24GB GDDR6X\n\nCUDA cores\n\n24,576\n\n16,384\n\nL2 cache\n\n128MB\n\n72MB\n\nBoost clock\n\n2.9GHz\n\n2.52GHz\n\nArchitecture\n\nBlackwell\n\nAda Lovelace\n\nMemory bus width\n\n384-bit\n\n384-bit\n\nMemory bandwidth\n\n1,536 GB/s\n\n1,008 GB/s\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 5000 series: What we could see\n\nPotential MCM design\n\nUnlike AMD, Nvidia has stuck to monolithic dies for its graphics cards. A monolithic chip has all the circuitry on the same die, which makes it difficult to shrink the transistors without increasing the overall chip size. In contrast, a Multi-Chip Module (MCM) approach involves adding separate chips (called chiplets) connected via interposers onto a single substrate. This increases the scalability of MCM-based chips and allows manufacturers to squeeze in better specs.\n\nAccording to leaker Kopite7kimi, Nvidia's GB100 and GB102 data center chips will feature an MCM design instead of the traditional monolithic architecture. Likewise, the high-end GB202 chip is expected to bring the MCM architecture to consumer GPUs.\n\nHowever, this new design probably won't be included in the GB203, GB205, GB206, and GB207 chips as Nvidia will go with the same old monolithic architecture for its budget and mid-range GPUs.\n\nHigher bandwidth GDDR7 memory\n\nMany GPU enthusiasts were disappointed with the Ada Lovelace family because Nvidia decided to bring over the GDDR6X and GDDR6 memory from older GPUs. Luckily, the rumor mill claims that the flagship graphics card(s) from the RTX 5000 series will leverage the latest GDDR7 memory.\n\nFor reference, the GeForce RTX 4090 had a memory bandwidth of 1,008 GB/s, which is the same as that of the last-gen GeForce RTX 3090 Ti. In contrast, the memory bandwidth of the RTX 5090 is rumored to be 1,536 GB/s, which is a staggering 52% upgrade!\n\nIt was also believed that the GeForce RTX 5090 would have a larger 512-bit memory bus. Sadly, this rumor was later dispelled by kopite7kimi, who stated that the flagship Blackwell graphics card would feature the same 384-bit bus as the RTX 4090 and RTX 3090 Ti.\n\nNew 3nm manufacturing process (with a higher core count)\n\nNvidia has continued to utilize newer manufacturing processes over the last couple of GPU generations, and the Blackwell series is no different. Team Green's upcoming GPU family will be based on TSMC's 3nm process node, which is smaller than the Ada Lovelace series' 5nm node.\n\nIn an older tweet, kopite7kimi revealed that there won't be a significant increase in the number of Graphics Processing Clusters (GPCs) and Texture Processor Clusters (TPCs) on the new GPUs. Additionally, panzerlied claimed that besides a 15% increase in frequency and 78% more cache, the RTX 5090 could see a 50% improvement in scale, which could translate to a higher 24,576 CUDA core count.\n\nSupport for PCIe 5.0 and DisplayPort 2.1\n\nAlthough the Ada Lovelace GPUs will work with PCIe 5.0 motherboards, they aren't able to make full use of the high-speed interface standard. However, it's expected that the Blackwell GPUs will be able to leverage the lightning-fast data transfer speeds provided by PCI Express Gen 5.0.\n\nLikewise, the GeForce RTX 5000 graphics cards are rumored to be a step up from their predecessors in terms of display capabilities. According to kopite7kimi, the new GPUs will be compatible with the DisplayPort 2.1 standard, which supports much higher bandwidth, refresh rate, and resolution than the last-gen DisplayPort 1.4.\n\nRelated PCI Express 5 (PCIe 5.0): Here's everything you need to know about the new standard PCIe 5.0 is the next big thing in the computing space.\n\nConclusion\n\nAnd that was all the information we have on Team Green's upcoming graphics cards. Although many of these leaks were disclosed by somewhat trustworthy sources, you should take them with a grain of salt. After all, the Ada Lovelace family was rumored to have an RTX 4090 Ti bearing a max TDP of 800W at the top of the pecking order, though the claims were eventually put to rest.\n\nNevertheless, we're still a long way from the actual release of the GPUs. Even if Nvidia delays the Blackwell family until 2025, we're bound to hear more details later this year. But if you're unable to wait for the Blackwell series, the GeForce RTX 4070 is a fantastic mid-range graphics card that provides solid performance without costing a fortune.\n\nRelated MSI GeForce RTX 4070 Ventus 3X review: Great value 1440p gaming An affordable RTX 4070 performance with impressive 1440p results",

All prices are subject to change, and this article only reflects the prices available at time of publication.\n\nThe Raspberry Pi 5 has the fastest processor of any Raspberry Pi computer to date, but that's just one of the thing that sets it apart from earlier models. Another is its PCIe connector that enables high-speed connections to expansion boards.\n\nA bunch of companies have used that PCIe connector to build HATs that let you attach a PCIe NVMe SSD to a Raspberry Pi 5. But MCUzone MPW7 is a little different: it's a small board that lets you attach an M.2 2230 module. The MPW7 is available from AliExpress with prices starting at $10 (plus shipping).\n\nWhy would you want to add an M.2 2230 connector to a Raspberry Pi 5? Because while the little computer has built-in support for wireless connectivity, the integrated hardware tops out at WiFi 5 and Bluetooth 5.0.\n\nThis adapter lets you add a WiFi 6, WiFi 6E, or WiFi 7 module with support for faster speeds, lower latency, and additional network bands, among other things. MCUZone says the board supports wireless modules including Intel's:\n\nNote that the $10 starting price for the MPW7 will get you the board, an FPC cable (for connecting to the PCIe interface on a Raspberry Pi 5) and a set of four screws for fastening the board on top of the single-board computer.\n\nUsers who plan to use the board to add a wireless module might want to spend at least $2 more on a bundle that also includes a pair of wireless antennas. Or you can spend a little more for a bundle that also includes an aluminum case designed to house a Raspberry Pi 5 + MPW7.\n\nBut the MPW7 isn't only useful for connecting wireless cards. You can also use it for other M.2 2230 cards, including an AI accelerator featuring Google Edge TPU coprocessors.\n\nOne other thing to keep in mind is that if you plan to use the MPW7 for Bluetooth, you'll need to run a cable from a connector on the board to one of the Raspberry Pi's USB ports.",

        "content": "The Pirate Queen: A Forgotten Legend, a unique adventure game starring Lucy Liu, gets treated to a release date and new gameplay trailer.\n\nHighlights\n\nThe Pirate Queen: A Forgotten Legend releases on Steam and Meta Quest Store on March 7. The VR adventure game starring Lucy Liu tells the story of a dramatic pirate captaincy succession inspired by true events. Its gameplay loop will revolve around narrative-driven exploration and puzzle-solving. The game's price tag has yet to be announced.\n\nThe Pirate Queen: A Forgotten Legend releases March 7, Singer Studios has announced. The virtual reality adventure game starring Lucy Liu will launch simultaneously on Steam and Meta Quest Store.\n\nSinger Studios unveiled The Pirate Queen: A Forgotten Legend with a brief video teaser shared in May 2023. The game itself is a revised take on The Pirate Queen: A Night of Succession, a short VR experience that the British production company debuted in 2021 to widespread acclaim, amassing multiple accolade nominations and winning The Discovery Award for Best Debut at the Raindance Film Festival. While both A Night of Succession and A Forgotten Legend tell the story of a dramatic pirate captaincy transition inspired by true events, the latter also happens to star Hollywood veteran Lucy Liu.\n\nRelated VR Gaming's Biggest AAA Supporter Is 'Disappointed' With Game Sales By far the biggest supporter of VR gaming among AAA publishers says it's 'disappointed' with its recent game sales in the sector.\n\nNine months after first teasing its revised take on The Pirate Queen, Singer Studios has at last treated the game to a release date: March 7. The developer has yet to reveal how much its VR adventure will actually cost, but Meta Quest and Steam users can already wishlist it on their preferred storefront. This will be the second pirate-themed game to release in a span of less than a month, arriving mere weeks after Ubisoft's Skull and Bones hit early access following half a dozen delays.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nAlthough the release date announcement trailer contains a line instructing Lucy Liu's character to \"stick to the shadows,\" none of the other footage that Singer Studios has revealed so far suggests the game will feature VR stealth sections. Instead, the gameplay loop of The Pirate Queen: A Forgotten Legend appears to revolve around exploration and puzzle-solving, both of which will be narrative-driven.\n\nThe Pirate Queen: A Forgotten Legend Supported Platforms\n\nMeta Quest 2 Meta Quest 3 PCVR\n\nThe Pirate Queen: A Forgotten Legend will mark Lucy Liu's return to the gaming sphere following a 12-year hiatus. Her last video game credit dates back to the 2012 Sleeping Dogs, in which she voiced singer Vivienne Lu. Prior to that, Liu lent her voice to Game Over in Machinimation, a free 2004 shooter meant to promote the animated miniseries Game Over, in which she also starred. Her first voice acting gaming gigs date back to Charlie's Angels and SSX Tricky, released in 2003 and 2001, respectively.\n\nClose\n\nOther than The Pirate Queen: A Forgotten Legend, the actress has several other projects coming out this year. The biggest of that bunch, budget-wise, is the action comedy Red One, in which Lucy Liu will star alongside Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans. Red One hits the silver screens on November 15.\n\nMeta Quest 3\n\nThe Meta Quest 3 is the latest and greatest mixed-reality headset that brings a host of improvements compared to the previous generation. The Quest 3 has higher resolution displays per eye with support for 90Hz and 120Hz refresh rates.\n\nIt uses a more powerful 2nd generation Snapdragon XR2 processor that is capable of running games like Asgard's Wrath 2 natively. It comes with a full-color passthrough, improved controllers, and a slimmer form factor.\n\nBrand Meta Resolution (per eye) 2064x2208 Display Type LCD Storage 128 GB, 512 GB Connectivity WiFi 6E, USB Type-C Battery Life 2-3 hours Tracking Technology Direct Touch hand tracking Audio Stereo speakers Weight 515 grams Refresh rate 90Hz, 120Hz (experimental) Processor Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 RAM 8GB $500 at Amazon$499 at Best Buy$499 at Walmart$499 at Newegg",

        "title": "Looking Back at Palworld's Original Trailer, the Game Sure Turned Out Differently (For the Better?)",
        "content": "Palworld first announced itself to the world two years ago with a reveal trailer that definitely caught people everywhere off-guard. It wasn't just your run-of-the-mill survival crafting game, it featured the ability to find a wide variety of adorable creatures known simply as Pals and capture them inside, well, 'Pal Spheres'.\n\nIt vigorously rang a bell inside many of our heads alongside echoes of a certain Pokemon jingle, and then blindsided us yet again with both humans and Pals wielding what looked to be actual guns. This cutely animated world with collectible creatures and destructive explosions prompted two questions: What in the world were we witnessing, and how long would it be before Nintendo brought down the gavel to legally erase this eccentric concept from existence?\n\nThe so-called \"Pokemon with guns\" game known as Palworld showed off what looked like an incredibly colorful and fun experience in a world full of giant castles, rolling green hills, crystal blue lakes, and most importantly Pals of every make and color. From the small Lamball to the gigantic Jormuntide, they weren't just there to look cute and cool, they could be used for all manner of tasks and adventures.\n\nClips in the initial trailer featured Direhowls pulling wagons of supplies, Mozzarinas harvesting wheat, Pengullets stacked atop each other to haul up lumber for a house, Teafant and Kelpsea watering crops, all of them helping the player's character build a sanctuary and survive in this mysterious land.\n\nOf course, a factor of that survival comes in the form of...surprisingly realistic artillery. Handguns, rocket launchers, miniguns, you name it. This was perhaps what helped Palworld differ itself just enough from its Pocket Monster cousin, because you certainly never found adolescent-age trainers brandishing a glock in one hand and a Pokeball in the other.\n\nPalworld was the new kid on the block to put a bold new spin on the 'creature capture' genre that has long been dominated by, well, one very famous entity. Despite the universal presumption that this new game would get legally shot down before even releasing, people were still genuinely curious about it and seemed to want to try it.\n\nTwo years passed with nothing but crickets from Nintendo's corner, and thus that curiosity from the player community grew dramatically leading up to Palworld's anticipated release in mid-January. The game leaped up into the top five most wishlisted games on Steam, and that wouldn't even turn out to be remotely the most impressive statistic.\n\nOn January 19th, Palworld rolled out the Early Access welcome mat for everyone for a very modest price of $30 USD, and what transpired would end up rattling the entire industry to its core.\n\nPalworld's servers, which were well-prepared for a decent enough crowd, instead became absolutely overwhelmed in a matter of minutes by not just thousands, but hundreds of thousands of players. While those going on solo adventures faired better in terms of server stability, those who wanted to embark on one with friends faced bigger challenges.\n\nMultiplayer instances crashed repeatedly, leaving a number of players barely able to play the game at all. Thus began the true test for the team at Pocketpair, who themselves likely underestimated how wild and ambitious Palworld would truly become.\n\nAs the hours passed, the player count went higher and higher, with many in Palworld's blossoming community surprisingly patient and assured that the gameplay experience would smooth out. That faith would pay off in spades, as Pocketpair worked resolutely around the clock to stabilize the server infrastructure and polish several bug issues, providing consistent updates on such via their official Discord.\n\nNot only that, they also marked some truly incredible milestones, first announcing that the game had sold over one million copies in just 8 hours. Palworld's concurrent player count on Steam peaked at a staggering all-time high of 2.1 million players, surpassing every other game on the platform for a time including the likes of Counter-Strike 2 and Baldur's Gate 3.\n\nBy the end of the month, in just under two weeks, Palworld achieved over 19 million players who have wholeheartedly embraced this astonishingly fun new addition to the creature-capture niche.\n\nWith the game now about to be a month old (definitely feels longer than that by now), some players have been taking the time to reflect on the roller coaster experience they've had with Palworld thus far. One person going by the name of 'Unhappy_Panic_1875' took to Reddit to put a spotlight on how surprisingly different the game turned out to be, at least by comparison to the very first trailer that appeared in 2022.\n\nIn fact, all of the screenshots we've shared so far are from that trailer. The Early Access version of Palworld we've gotten deviated substantially from the original aesthetic, changed the look of some Pals while others we haven't even seen (yet?), and either did away with certain Pal mechanics entirely or changed/refined them.\n\nFor instance, the game's overall environment changed from a sort of alternate medieval setting with castles and villages everywhere to a diverse island archipelago known as Palpagos, filled with mysterious ruins and very simplistic villages built with wood and metal instead of stonework. Palworld also migrated from Unity to Unreal Engine 4 during development, which opened up new doors for the team to make a more immersive, engaging, and modern experience.\n\nIt likely made traversing the entire world map without loading screens (save for dungeons) possible. Pals like Teafant and Mozzarina saw their designs changed (better, honestly), and various crafting mechanics like farming saw impressive upgrades.\n\nMeanwhile, other things noticeably dropped off the development conveyor belt, such as Direhowls pulling carriage carts (seen above), Lamballs being shaved for wool instead of shaking it off in a Ranch pen, flying Pals transporting cages full of smaller Pals, lassoing Pals to capture them, space rocket building (for what??), more advanced syndicate hideouts, fishing with Pals as bait, ship travel, gigantic base locales, and more.\n\nThe concept of Pals wielding and manufacturing weapons even got uplifted from its initial, red-hued dystopian vibe to a more lively, action-packed one, with Pals eager to fight alongside you rather than looking more apathetic than Depresso.\n\nIt goes without saying that the Palworld we have now is very different than the prototype we saw two years ago, but that obviously didn't shake anyone's opinion in the game's rock-solid community one bit. It soared astronomically past all expectations, broke Steam records left and right, had famous streamers far and wide broadcasting their experiences, and above all, it excelled beyond the scrutiny of its aforementioned moniker as \"Pokemon with guns\".\n\nThe long-winded discourse of its undeniable similarities to the Pocket Monster universe has since gradually deflated. People know, but frankly, they honestly don't care. If anything, the game has become a proverbial soap box to give Nintendo a very loud wake-up call about what players actually want.\n\nThe next big question is whether some of these differences and changes to the game will emerge in future updates. On top of doubling the current Pal count, we know for certain that Pocketpair wants to integrate more interactive content such as PvP, a Pal battle arena (which was featured in the original trailer), expand Pal trading between players, more new island areas, bosses, and more. They're also putting serious amounts of money into their server infrastructure, to ensure that no more crash-laden catastrophes happen.\n\nThey're definitely in it for the long haul, and we can't help but wonder if perhaps other things we saw two years ago will make a comeback. Some things like bizarrely building rocket ships and hauling distressed Pals in cages were definitely left behind with good reason, and with the ability to mount Pals and fast travel to various locales, having Direhowls haul carriages seems pointless. The ability to give them belly rubs however would be an adorable touch.\n\nAt this point, Palworld's future is exceptionally bright, and millions of players are anxiously waiting to continue their adventures with more new content. Whether Nintendo will follow up with any sort of tangible response to its first-ever true competitor remains to be seen, but regardless of what happens, Palworld has made its rousing mark on the gaming world.\n\nIt's outstandingly achieved what other, far larger companies have seldom done, all without battle passes, microtransactions, or bait-and-switch gimmicks. Pocketpair has given us so much for a price that's frankly too low, but nevertheless, it speaks volumes when a team creates something genuine, with all the heart and soul you could ever ask for.",

However, the Tensor G3 in last year's Google Pixel 8 Pro impressed us with enough raw power to make it a more serious contender for those looking for top-notch gaming and multitasking performance. Does it have enough to take on Samsung's extreme Galaxy S24 Ultra, especially now that Samsung is baking in similar AI to compete in Google's arena?

It clearly liked that aesthetic, as it's since brought it not only to the rest of the Galaxy S family, but even to its midrange and entry-level A-series phones. Hence, it's no surprise that Samsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra follows in the same footsteps.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean nothing's changed. This year, Samsung moved its flagship phone from its classic Armor Aluminum alloy to a titanium frame. While that technically allows it to shed a few grams, that's not the real bonus here, as there's a minimal weight difference between aluminum and titanium. Rather, the Galaxy S24 Ultra now gets a boost in durability, added scratch resistance, and a more attractive look. It also feels warmer to the touch and easier to keep a hold on. You may want to think twice about putting this one in a case.\n\nSimilarly, Google's Pixel 8 Pro can be tricky to distinguish from its predecessor at first glance unless you know what you're looking for. It sports Google's signature camera bar that helps set the Pixel family apart from other smartphones, but now combines the lenses into a single cutout. However, once you pick it up and look a bit closer, it's clear Google has made some nice design refinements that add a touch of elegance and craftsmanship. The glass back is now matte, making it less of a fingerprint magnet, and it feels great in the hand, especially with the corners being more rounded.\n\nWhile the Galaxy S24 Ultra technically comes in slightly larger and heftier with its 6.8-inch screen, it's not significantly more so than the Pixel 8 Pro. We're talking about 2.5 millimeters in width and 20 grams in weight; the extra tenth-of-an-inch for the display comes from narrower bezels on Samsung's part, and any difference when holding the new phones can be chalked up to the different materials and designs used in each. Glass and titanium feel very different, and Samsung and Google have also gone in opposite directions with the edges, with the Pixel 8 Pro getting more curves while the Galaxy S24 Ultra gets less.\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra does have an edge over the Pixel 8 Pro in terms of durability, with Samsung opting for Corning's latest Gorilla Armor Glass this year. It's more scratch-resistant and less reflective than last year's Gorilla Glass Victus 2, which is still used on the Pixel 8 Pro. It's unclear how much of a difference this makes in impact protection, but the reduced glare keeps the screen noticeably more visible when dealing with bright overhead lights or direct sunlight. Both phones also feature an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. Samsung specifies up to 1.5 meters of protection for 30 minutes on the Galaxy S24 Ultra. While Google has never said precisely what its IP68 rating means, we expect it's very similar, as IP68 has to offer more than one meter of water resistance for at least 30 minutes.\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra and Pixel 8 Pro both feature stunning designs in their own ways, and while Samsung's phone has some minor advantages with its newer Armor Glass, we don't think those are enough to tilt the scales over what ultimately comes down to a personal choice for buyers.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nGalaxy S24 Ultra vs. Pixel 8 Pro: display\n\nSamsung's phones have always had some of the best AMOLED displays on the market, which is no surprise considering that Samsung has its own display division that produces a large percentage of the displays used on every phone on the market -- including the Pixel 8 Pro.\n\nHowever, Samsung naturally reserves its best displays for its smartphones, and the best of the best naturally land in its top-of-the-line Galaxy S24 Ultra. What you're getting here isn't a significant change from last year's Galaxy S23 Ultra -- it's still a 6.8-inch AMOLED 2X panel with a 1Hz to 120Hz adaptive refresh rate and a negligible bump to a 3120 x 1440 resolution -- but it's gotten much brighter, with a new peak outdoor brightness of 2,600 nits.\n\nWe found that to be a noticeable increase from the 1,750 of the S23 Ultra, which, combined with the new Gorilla Armor Glass, makes the screen much easier to see on even the brightest days. The Adaptive Brightness also behaves well when working in bright light, avoiding the temptation to automatically dim your screen to save a bit of battery life.\n\nGoogle's Pixel 8 Pro has adopted a different display from its predecessor, which the company has dubbed its new \"Super Actua\" display. It's an LTPO OLED screen with the same 120Hz variable refresh rate and always-on capabilities, but it's pushes the outdoor brightness up to 2,400 nits. That was the best we'd seen on any smartphone when the Pixel 8 Pro was released; it's naturally been leapfrogged by Samsung and others since, but it's more of a paper chase now as we're reaching the point of diminishing returns. Anything above 2,000 nits seems to be good enough for most outdoor use, and it's unlikely you'll notice much difference between Google's 2,400 nits and Samsung's 2,600 nits in raw brightness. If anything, Samsung's new glass helps with outdoor visibility far more than those extra 200 nits.\n\nLike Samsung, the biggest change in Google's display is the increased brightness. It offers a 2992 x 1344 resolution for a density of 489 pixels per inch (ppi). That's slightly lower than the 505 ppi on the Galaxy S24 Ultra, but it's not a difference you'll notice with the naked eye. However, the Pixel 8 Pro has another trick up its sleeve that helps narrow the gap with the S24 Ultra: it can now dial the refresh rate down to the same 1Hz, letting it use less battery power in always-on display mode.\n\nBoth displays deliver excellent quality, with deep, rich colors and crisp text, and we don't think anyone will be disappointed with either. Still, Samsung gains a new edge with an improved always-on display that departs from the classic monochromatic look that's graced most Android phones. Instead, it seems to have taken a page out of Apple's book by allowing a more colorful view that allows you to keep a dimmed version of your wallpaper and notifications in view.\n\nThat became a polarizing feature when Apple introduced it -- people seemed to either love it or hate it -- and Apple eventually had to provide a way to turn it off. Samsung has learned from that, and it's wisely offering that option out of the gate. You don't have to use it if you don't want to, but it's hard to argue that it's a nice option to have and makes the Galaxy S24 Ultra stand out from the pack.\n\nWinner: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra\n\nGalaxy S24 Ultra vs. Pixel 8 Pro: performance and battery\n\nSamsung has once again worked with Qualcomm to bring its own bespoke version of the chipmaker's latest flagship system-on-a-chip (SoC) to the Galaxy S24 Ultra. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is already a ridiculously powerful chip, and Samsung's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy coaxes even more out of it for Samsung's top-performing flagship and its One UI 6.1 flavor of Android. According to Qualcomm, that works out to a boost of 20% in the CPU and 26% in the GPU over last year's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy, compared to a 30% performance boost between the two non-Galaxy generations of the SoC.\n\nPacking in 12GB of RAM across all of its storage configurations, the S24 Ultra not only had no problems handling the latest demanding mobile games, but also ran surprisingly cool, suggesting there's power here to spare. For instance, we found that extended playtimes of games like Asphalt 9: Legends barely warmed things up; it took demanding benchmarking tests to make a noticeable difference, but the S24 Ultra never got too hot to handle.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Google's Pixel 8 Pro still packs in one of the company's own Tensor chips -- a third-generation Tensor G3 in this case -- but the good news is that Google has made some nice improvements to performance and thermal management compared to the previous iterations of the chip. In announcing the Tensor G3, Google promised that \"every major subsystem has been upgraded,\" which translates to a noticeable performance boost.\n\nCan it hold its own against the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy? Although the Tensor G3 doesn't match the raw benchmarks on paper, in practical terms, we don't think most folks will notice any difference worth caring about. The Pixel 8 Pro could handle everything we threw at it, including the latest demanding mobile games and multitasking between multiple apps. There was no stuttering or lagging, nor any of the overheating problems that plagued the Tensor G2-equipped Pixel 7 lineup. It seems Google has finally decided to shift away from its somewhat myopic focus on machine learning that hampered its previous Tensor chips.\n\nWe're long past the point where raw power means much to the user-facing experience on flagship smartphones. Instead, the extra headroom provided by both the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy and the Tensor G3 is there to power more sophisticated features like computational photography and AI. And this year, Qualcomm has changed that equation, moving onto Google's turf by adding some sophisticated machine learning capabilities to its latest premium Snapdragon chip. We'll talk more about those later.\n\nIf there area any areas where the Galaxy S24 Ultra is a clear winner, it's in its battery life and charging performance. While the Pixel 8 Pro should get you through a full day thanks to the Tensor G3's improved power efficiency, that still doesn't hold a candle to the incredible stamina of the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which can end a busy day with 50% remaining, even after five hours of screen time used for gaming, video streaming, and calls. That's despite both phones having similar-sized batteries (5,000mAh for the S24 Ultra and 5,050mAh for the Pixel 8 Pro), so it's a testament to Samsung and Qualcomm's power-management capabilities.\n\nWith its usual 45-watt charging, the Galaxy S24 Ultra still isn't the fastest-charging smartphone on the market -- that honor still goes to the OnePlus 12 -- but it still beats out the Pixel 8 Pro's 30W speeds. Practically, that works out to about a 20-minute difference in the time it takes to charge each phone from zero to full -- 70 minutes for the S24 Ultra versus 90 minutes for the Pixel 8 Pro.\n\nWinner: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra\n\nGalaxy S24 Ultra vs. Pixel 8 Pro: cameras\n\nWhen it comes to cameras, Samsung puts the most premium camera hardware available into its Galaxy Ultra phones, while Google leans toward slightly above-average sensors driven by sophisticated computational photography algorithms.\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra and Pixel 8 Pro both follow that trend, although each has been gradually encroaching into the other's territory. This year, Samsung is taking advantage of the new AI and image-processing capabilities of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 to power new photo and video experiences, while also borrowing a page from some of its competitors by using pixel-cropping techniques to offer more optical-quality focal lengths. For its part, Google has packed some nice sensor upgrades into the Pixel 8 Pro to give the computational photography engine in its Tensor G3 more to work with.\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra came with a change that surprised many folks at first blush: the elimination of its legendary 10x telephoto lens in favor of a 5x shooter. However, there was a method to Samsung's seeming madness, as it also upped its best telephoto camera to a 50-megapixel (MP) sensor, a huge jump from the 10MP one on the S23 Ultra that not only delivers better quality images, but also still lets you capture 10x optical-quality shots with its Adaptive Pixel Sensor Technology. Of course, the digital zoom capabilities are all still here, with to a 100x \"Space Zoom.\"\n\nCombined with the 3x telephoto lens, which remains mostly unchanged from last year, this provides Galaxy S24 Ultra owners with a new and arguably much more useful 5x zoom to play with since it's entirely optical. As for the 10x zoom, technically you'll only be shooting a 10MP photo in that mode, as Samsung is using a pixel-cropping technique to double the 5x zoom by using the center of the 50MP sensor, but that's the same resolution the Galaxy S23 Ultra provided with its 10MP 10x telephoto camera, and the results speak for themselves.\n\nGoogle's Pixel 8 Pro has improved the sensors of its predecessor in light capture, with the main 50MP shooter promised to collect 21% more light and the two 48MP sensors in the telephoto and ultrawid, increasing that by 56% and 105%, respectively.\n\nWhile those numbers may not look nearly as impressive as Samsung's 200MP main sensor and dual telephoto lenses, the computational photography features of Google's Tensor chips have always managed to produce exceptional results with relatively modest camera sensors. The Pixel 8 Pro effortlessly takes the kind of phenomenal photos we've come to expect from a Pixel phone. Colors are natural, balanced, and lively without being oversaturated, and there's plenty of detail. For the company that pioneered night mode smartphone photography, it's also no surprise that the Pixel 8 Pro still produces the best night mode photos you'll find -- and they've only gotten better with the increased light sensitivity of the cameras.\n\nThat's not to say the Galaxy S24 Ultra is lacking in any meaningful way. If you want the best telephoto lens system you can get on a smartphone, and prefer photos that are more punchy, vibrant, and colorful, Samsung's flagship is the phone for you. The good news is that Samsung also seems to have dialed the saturation down a bit compared to last year's model, so while it's not quite as ideally balanced as the Pixel 8 Pro, colors do look more natural.\n\nThe bottom line is that both phones take great pictures with different trade-offs. The Pixel 8 Pro will give you more natural hues and better lowlight and night shots, while the Galaxy S24 Ultra provides exceptional zoom capabilities with more vibrant colors that may not appeal to everyone.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nGalaxy S24 Ultra vs. Pixel 8 Pro: software and updates\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra and Pixel 8 Pro both ship with Android 14, although Google provides its usual \"pure Google\" experience while Samsung layers its One UI 6.1 on top. Each of these will appeal to a different audience, and despite the Pixel 8 Pro running just Android 14 sans any \"skins,\" it still packs in its own set of unique features specific to Google's Pixel lineup.\n\nHowever, Google raised the stakes last year when it promised a staggering seven years of Android updates and Pixel Feature Drops that will keep its latest flagship phone relevant until October 2030, when Android 21 comes along.\n\nNot to be outdone, Samsung has followed suit, matching Google's promise with its Galaxy S24 lineup, which should also take it to Android 21 and One UI 13.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nGalaxy S24 Ultra vs. Pixel 8 Pro: special features\n\nWhile Google's Pixel lineup has been the undisputed king of AI features for the past few years, Samsung is throwing its hat into the ring with the Galaxy S24 Ultra and a new suite of Galaxy AI capabilities.\n\nThese primarily come thanks to the improvements in Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, which has embraced machine learning in a big way. Samsung is leveraging these new capabilities to build new translation, transcription, and photo-editing features that could theoretically give Google a run for its money.\n\nHowever, the key word here is \"theoretically.\" Google has a healthy head start in this area, both in software features and in the neural engines in its Tensor chips. By comparison, Samsung is a babe in the woods, and it shows with Galaxy AI.\n\nFor example, one of the most compelling AI features on the Galaxy S24 Ultra is Circle to Search by Google, but that's not an exclusive feature. As the name suggests, Google built it, so it was inevitable that it would come to the Pixel 8 Pro, along with some other cool generative AI enhancements for composing messages and transforming photos into stickers.\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra also includes new Interpreter and Live Translate features that can translate both live in-person conversations and phone calls in real time, plus AI-generated summaries and transcriptions in Samsung Notes that can transcribe and translate voice recordings to text from multiple speakers.\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra also gains some photo- and video-editing capabilities that can fill in backgrounds and suggest enhancements to images. An AI-assisted slow-motion mode can also turn a regular video into a slow-motion one by interpolating the missing frames needed to slow it down. It works well and lets you create more whimsical experiences by slowing down only selected portions.\n\nStill, many of these are features that Google's Pixel phones have had for a while in some form or another. Google's Magic Eraser has become almost legendary, and this year, it bolstered it with Audio Magic Eraser to do the same for audio clips, plus a Magic Editor feature that goes beyond simply erasing objects to let you move them around and change the lightning.\n\nBeyond photographic features, the Pixel 8 Pro also includes built-in proofreading tools in Gboard, object and pet recognition for the selfie camera, and the ability for Google Assistant to summarize a web page for you. Suffice it to say that Google will likely remain ahead of the curve on the AI side for a while, although Galaxy AI will at least help Samsung fans look less longingly at what they're missing.\n\nHowever, with all the hype around generative AI these days, it may be hard to believe there's still more to a phone than just AI features. But the Galaxy S24 Ultra has at least one thing that makes it stand out from the pack in the form of its S Pen. It's hard to beat for those who would rather jot their thoughts down on the expansive 6.8-inch screen than type them in.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nGalaxy S24 Ultra vs. Pixel 8 Pro: price and availability\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra comes in at $100 more this year, with the base 256GB model starting at $1,300. There are also higher 512GB and 1TB storage capacities available. You can find it at most major retailers and carriers in Titanium Gray, Titanium Black, Titanium Violet, and Titanium Yellow, with exclusive Titanium Blue, Titanium Green, and Titanium Orange colors available if you order directly from Samsung.\n\nGoogle's Pixel 8 Pro starts at a much more wallet-friendly $999, although that will only get you a 128GB model. However, you can move up to a comparable 256GB configuration for only $60 more. It's available for purchase now from Google and other retailers and comes in Obsidian, Porcelain, and Bay colors.\n\nGalaxy S24 Ultra vs. Pixel 8 Pro: verdict\n\nEven at the same price, the choice between Samsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra and Google Pixel 8 Pro would be a tough call, but Google's flagship has one essential thing going for it: It can be had for $300 less than Samsung's beastly powerhouse.\n\nAt this price, we think the Pixel 8 Pro is the best flagship for most people. It takes excellent pictures under a wide range of conditions, the new Tensor G3 chip delivers the performance needed by everyone except the most hardcore mobile gamers, and Google also has a proven track record in delivering AI features that work well. The only significant knocks against the Pixel 8 Pro are its average battery life and slower charging; however, there's still enough here to get most folks through a full day of use between charges.\n\nNone of that is to say that Samsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra doesn't have its own set of advantages. You get the best telephoto cameras available on any smartphone today with substantially longer-range zoom capabilities while still being able to capture outstanding photos. There's also little doubt that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip can handle anything you throw at it without breaking a sweat -- and it's likely to provide that top-tier performance for another couple of years, even as new Android and One UI updates demand more from it. While the jury is still out on the Galaxy AI features and where the line is drawn between \"useful\" and \"gimmick,\" if you leave those aside, it's still an ideal phone for those who want no-compromise performance and are willing to pay the premium to get it.\n\nEditors' Recommendations The best Samsung Galaxy S23 cases in 2024: our 19 favorites I love the Google Pixel 8 Pro -- except for one thing Samsung is fixing an annoying display issue on the Galaxy S24 The best Samsung phones in 2024: our 8 favorite Galaxy handsets Best Google Pixel 8 deals: Save $800 on the latest Pixel",

        "title": "Vision Pro review: Apple's first headset lacks polish and purpose",
        "content": "By The New York Times News Service Syndicate | wordpress@medianewsgroup.com\n\nAbout 17 years ago, Steve Jobs took the stage at a San Francisco convention center and said he was introducing three products: an iPod, a phone and an internet browser.\n\n\"These are not three separate devices,\" he said. \"This is one device, and we are calling it iPhone.\"\n\nAt $500, the first iPhone was relatively expensive, but I was eager to dump my mediocre Motorola flip phone and splurge. There were flaws -- including sluggish cellular internet speeds. But the iPhone delivered on its promises.\n\nOver the past week, I've had a very different experience with a new first-generation product from Apple: the Vision Pro, a virtual reality headset that resembles a pair of ski goggles. The $3,500 wearable computer, which was released Friday, uses cameras so you can see the outside world while juggling apps and videos.\n\nApple calls it a \"spatial computer\" that blends together the physical and digital worlds for people to work, watch movies and play games.\n\nApple declined to provide an early review unit to The New York Times, so I bought a Vision Pro on Friday. (It costs much more than $3,500 with the add-ons that many people will want, including a $200 carrying case, $180 AirPods and $100 prescription lens inserts for people who wear glasses.) After using the headset for about five days, I'm unconvinced that people will get much value from it.\n\nThe device feels less polished than past first-generation Apple products I've used. It's not better for doing work than a computer, and the games I've tried so far aren't fun, which makes it difficult to recommend. An important feature -- the ability to place video calls with a humanlike digital avatar that resembles the wearer -- terrified children during a family FaceTime call.\n\nThe headset is superb at delivering on one of its promises: playing video, including high-definition movies and your own recordings in 3D that let you immerse yourself in past memories, which is both eerie and cool.\n\nIn the past decade, companies such as Meta, HTC and Sony have struggled mightily to sell headsets to mainstream consumers because their products were cumbersome to wear, their apps were limited and they looked uncool.\n\nThe Vision Pro has a superior user interface, better picture quality, more apps and higher computing power than other headsets. But it's slightly heavier than Meta's cheaper Quest headsets, and it plugs into an external battery pack that lasts only two hours.\n\nThe ski-goggle aesthetic of the Apple product looks better than the bulky plastic headset visors of the past. But the videos posted by early adopters walking around outside with the headset -- men I call Vision Bros -- confirm that people still look ridiculous wearing tech goggles, even when they are designed by Apple.\n\nThe Vision Pro is miles ahead of other headsets I've tested in making an immersive 3D interface simple for users to control with their eyes and hands. I let four colleagues wear the headset in the office and watched all of them learn to use it in seconds.\n\nThat's because it's familiar to anyone who owns an iPhone or a similar smartphone. You'll see a grid of app icons. Looking at an app is equivalent to hovering over it with a mouse cursor; to click on it, you tap your thumb and index finger together, making a quick pinch. The pinch gesture can also be used to move around and expand windows.\n\nThe Vision Pro includes a knob called the Digital Crown. Turning it counterclockwise lets you see the real world in the background while keeping digital windows of your apps in the foreground. Turning it clockwise hides the real world with an opaque background.\n\nI preferred to see into physical reality most of the time, but I still felt isolated. The headset cuts off part of your periphery, creating a binoculars-like effect. I confess that it was hard at times to remember to walk my dogs because I didn't see them or hear their whining, and in another session, I tripped over a stool. An Apple spokesperson referred to the Vision Pro's safety guidelines, which advise users to clear away obstacles.\n\nWhen using the headset for work, you can surround yourself with multiple floating apps -- your spreadsheet can be in the center, a notes app to your right and a browser to your left, for example. It's the 3D version of juggling windows on a computer screen. As neat as that sounds, pinching floating screens doesn't make working more efficient because you need to keep twisting your head to see them.\n\nI could tolerate juggling a notes app, a browser and the Microsoft Word app for no longer than 15 minutes before feeling nauseated.\n\nThe least joyful part of the Vision Pro is typing with its floating keyboard, which requires poking one key at a time. I had planned to write this review with the headset before realizing I wouldn't make my deadline.\n\nThere's an option to connect a physical keyboard, but at that point I'd rather use a laptop that doesn't add weight to my face.\n\nThe Vision Pro can also work with Mac computers, where you can mirror the screen into the headset as a virtual window that can be expanded to look like a large display. In my tests, there was a consistent lag -- each keystroke took a fraction of a second to register virtually, and the mouse cursor moved sluggishly. I also instinctively wanted to control the Mac with pinches, even though it's not set up to work that way, which was frustrating.\n\nNext I tried the headset in the kitchen, loading a pizza recipe in the web browser while I grabbed and measured ingredients. Moving around while looking through the camera, I became nauseated again and had to remove the headset. The Vision Pro is most comfortable to use while seated. Apple advises people to take breaks to reduce motion sickness.\n\nVideo calling is now an essential part of office life, and here the Vision Pro is especially inferior to a laptop with a camera. The headset uses its cameras to snap photos of your face that are stitched into a 3D avatar called a Persona, which Apple has labeled a \"beta\" feature because it is unfinished.\n\nPersonas are so cringe that people will be embarrassed to use these in a work call. The Vision Pro produced an unflattering portrait of me with no cheekbones and blurred ears. In a FaceTime call with my in-laws, they said the blur conjured 1980s studio portrait vibes.\n\nOne of my nieces, a 3-year-old, turned around and walked away at the sight of virtual Uncle Brian. The other, a 7-year-old, hid behind her father, whispering in his ear, \"He looks fake.\"\n\nVideo is where the Vision Pro shines. When streaming movies through apps such as Disney+ and Max, you can pinch the corner of a video and drag it to expand it into a jumbo high-resolution TV; some movies, such as \"Avengers: Endgame\" and \"Avatar 2,\" can be viewed in 3D. The picture looks much brighter and clearer than the quality in Meta's Quest products. Audio quality on the Apple headset is excellent, but the speakers are loud, so you'll need AirPods if you want to use them in public spaces.\n\nThe headset's two-hour battery life is not long enough to last through most feature-length movies, but in my experience, this turned out to be moot because I couldn't watch movies for more than 20 to 30 minutes before needing to rest my neck and eyes from the heavy headset.\n\n(A caveat: The Netflix and YouTube apps are not available on the Vision Pro, but their websites work OK for streaming content.)\n\nI prefer watching movies on my flat-screen TV because it can be shared, but there are scenarios where a headset would be useful as a personal television, such as in a small apartment or on a plane, or on the couch when someone else is watching a TV show that you'd like to tune out from.\n\nVideos shot on an iPhone 15 Pro camera or with the Vision Pro's cameras can be viewed in 3D on the headset, a feature called spatial videos. While watching a video of my dogs eating snacks at home, I could reach out and pretend to pet them. The videos looked grainy but were delightful.\n\nNot many games have been made for the headset yet. I tried some new Vision Pro games such as Blackbox, which involves moving around a 3D environment to pop bubbles and solve puzzles. It looked nice, but after the novelty wore off, my interest fizzled out. It's tough to recommend the Vision Pro for virtual-reality gaming when Meta's $250 Quest 2 and $500 Quest 3 headsets have a deeper library of games.\n\nThe Vision Pro is the start of something -- of what, exactly, I'm not sure.\n\nBut the point of a product review is to evaluate the here and now. In its current state, the Vision Pro is an impressive but incomplete first-generation product with problems and big trade-offs. Other than being a fancy personal TV, it lacks purpose.\n\nMost striking to me about the Vision Pro is, for such an expensive computer, how difficult it is to share the headset with others. There's a guest mode, but there's no ability to create profiles for different family members to load their own apps and videos.\n\nSo it's a computer for people to use alone, arriving at a time when we are seeking to reconnect after years of masked solitude. That may be the Vision Pro's biggest blind spot.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.",

A/V titans like Amazon, Roku, and Google, along with smart TVs from Samsung, Sony, and LG are just a few of the ways you'll be able to stream your favorite movies and shows from apps like Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video.\n\nToday, we'll be doing a side-by-side comparison of the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max and the Roku Streaming Stick 4K+. Both of these gadgets are excellent plug-and-play devices, but which is the best? Let's find out!\n\nRead our ranking Best streaming devices in 2024 There's a lot of competition out there to host your weekend binges and movie nights Price, specs & availability:\n\nThe Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max currently sells for $60, but the streaming device is usually on sale for $10 or $15 less. You can purchase the 4K Max from Amazon, as well and brick-and-mortar retail outlets (and websites) like Best Buy and Target.\n\nThe Roku Streaming Stick 4K+ is $80. You can still purchase the device through Amazon, although it looks like Roku is trying to phase out the 4K+ altogether, so stock is variable.\n\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2nd Gen, 2023)Roku Streaming Stick 4K PlusWhat's IncludedAlexa Voice Remote Enhanced, power cable and adapter, HDMI extender, 2 AAA batteriesRemote, Mini USBStorage16GB1GBRemoteAlexa Voice Remote EnhancedYesOperating SystemFire OS 8Roku TV OSResolution4K Ultra HD4K, 1080p, 720pHDR SupportHDR10+, Dolby Vision, HLG, HDR10HDR10, HDR10+, Dolby Vision, HLG Design\n\nBoth the Fire TV Stick 4K Max and Streaming Stick 4K+ feature minimalist designs.

Additional keys include four shortcut keys, a mic button for using Roku's voice assistant, and a convenient lost remote locator.\n\nSpeaking of which: Roku's two advantages over Amazon's remote are hands-free voice controls and a built-in rechargeable battery (via USB-C). To use voice commands, simply say \"Hey Roku,\" followed by a query or action. We're also glad to see the inclusion of a headphone jack for private listening (another thing you won't find on Amazon's remote).\n\nSoftware Source: Amazon\n\nIn terms of OS, the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max uses Amazon's Fire TV platform, while Roku opts for the tried and true Roku OS for the Streaming Stick 4K+.\n\nThe Fire TV platform is laid out in a cohesive manner, with bright colors and rows of big square tiles being the main UI elements you'll interact with. Fire TV tends to go a little overboard with Amazon advertising, but these first-party callouts are mostly for Amazon Prime Video and IMDB TV movies and shows.\n\nNavigating from screen to screen and selecting menu options feels fast and responsive, and Alexa responds quickly to voice commands of all types, including smart home actions.\n\nSource: Roku\n\nRoku has been perfecting the Roku TV OS for years, and while there haven't been too many changes, there are a few new tabs and options to choose from on the Home Screen.\n\nMovies, shows, and channels (what Roku calls apps) are featured prominently on this page. You'll be able to filter content searches by genre and other categories, and all of your favorite channels are laid out in colorful tiles on a default purple background.\n\nNavigating from screen to screen, and opening and closing apps is speedy and responsive, and even the Roku voice assistant responds to commands promptly and without a hitch.\n\nThe Roku TV OS also supports Apple AirPlay 2, so you'll be able to cast media and mirror the screen of an iPhone, iPad, or Mac computer. Fire TV supports Miracast and WiDi, but not AirPlay 2 or Chromecast.\n\nVideo and audio quality Source: Amazon\n\nThe Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max and Roku Streaming Stick 4K+ are industry leaders when it comes to HDR support and surround decoding. For the latter though, the 4K Max might be the better option for you and yours.\n\nHDR10, HDR10+, Dolby Vision, and the HLG format are supported by both streaming devices. This means you'll be able to experience some of the brightest and most colorful imagery when streaming 4K movies and shows with either peripheral.\n\nIf you're planning on using the 4K Max or Streaming Stick 4K+ with a Dolby Atmos soundbar or surround sound though, you'll want to go with Team Amazon. Unfortunately, the Roku Streaming Stick 4K+ doesn't support the Atmos codec.\n\nStorage and networking Source: Amazon\n\nWhen it comes to internal storage, the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is the clear winner. Offering up to 16GB of storage and 2GB of memory, the 4K Max trumps the single gigabyte you'll get with Roku's Streaming Stick 4K.\n\nThat being said, if you're the kind of person that downloads a ton of 4K movies and shows (instead of streaming them), you're going to hit that 16GB cap in the blink of an eye. If you prefer offline downloads to traditional streaming, you may want to invest in a network-attached storage device (NAS) or think about using Plex.\n\nAs far as network connectivity goes, the Fire TV Stick 4K Max supports the latest Wi-Fi 6e standard, which means you'll be able to connect to 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and the new 6GHz Wi-Fi bands. The Roku Streaming Stick 4K+ can be connected to 2.4GHz and 5GHz network bands, but lacks support for 6GHz connectivity.\n\nWhich is right for you?\n\nIf complete Dolby Atmos immersion is one of the most important parts of your movie and TV show-watching experience, the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max is probably going to be the best streaming device to go with. It also supports the latest Wi-Fi 6e networking standard and features 16GB of internal storage.\n\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2nd Gen, 2023) Better audio and internal storage\n\nDolby Atmos and Wi-Fi 6e\n\n$40 $60 Save $20\n\nThe Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max is one of the best Ultra HD streaming devices for watching movies and shows in full Dolby Atmos 5.1.2 surround (or higher).\n\n$40 at Amazon$40 at Best Buy\n\nEven though the Roku Streaming Stick 4K+ is being phased out, it's still a solid streaming device to nab while supplies last. Plus, it features hands-free voice control and Apple AirPlay 2 support.\n\nRoku Streaming Stick 4K Plus AirPlay 2 and hands-free voice controls\n\nScore a great deal while supplies last\n\nThe Roku Streaming Stick 4K+ connects to both 2.4GHz and 5GHz network bands.

        "title": "Samsung Galaxy S24 vs. Galaxy S22: How Samsung's flagship phone changed in just 2 years",
        "content": "A Samsung Galaxy S24 vs. Galaxy S22 comparison can help you decide if it's time to upgrade to a new phone. After all, it's been two years since the S22's release, which used to be about the time most people started considering a new handset.\n\nOf course, we're holding on to smartphones for longer stretches these days -- the average is around three years depending on who's doing the counting. And if you've got a Galaxy S22, you have what is still a very capable smartphone with a powerful chipset and very good cameras. You can easily expect to get another year's use out of your phone if the latest Samsung flagships don't convince you to upgrade.\n\nSamsung is hoping you will decide to splash out for its new phone, with the Galaxy AI features on board the Galaxy S24 being the primary motivator for a change in phones. But Samsung's flagship lineup has evolved in other ways, too, with design changes and new hardware that promise to improve performance and battery life from what the Galaxy S22 already delivers.\n\nNow that we've had a chance to test Samsung's new phone for our Galaxy S24 review, we can properly compare the latest handset to its older counterpart. In this Samsung Galaxy S24 vs. Galaxy S22 face-off, you can find out just exactly what improvements an upgrade can bring about.\n\nThe Galaxy S24 starts at $799, which is the same price the Galaxy S22 debuted at two years earlier. (You can find a lower price through Galaxy S24 deals.) Keeping the same price as an earlier model may not seem like that big a deal, but it's more than the Galaxy S24 Ultra can claim, after Samsung raised its price by $100 over its predecessor.\n\nOver the years, the Galaxy S22's price has dropped, first by $100 when the Galaxy S23 came out in 2023. These days, you can find an unlocked version of the phone for less than $500 -- an appropriate discount given that you would be paying for older hardware.\n\nWinner: Draw\n\nThough only two years have passed between the release of the Galaxy S22 and Galaxy S24, the appearance of the two phones feels like night and day. The S22 came out in the era when Samsung still used a raised area to set apart its rear cameras from the back of the phone. These days, the camera lenses on the Galaxy S24 poke out seamlessly from the handset's back panel. While I like the contour cut design Samsung using two years ago, I find the S24's look to be cleaner and more seamless.\n\nThe Galaxy S22 marked a switch to aluminum and glass for the entry-level Galaxy S flagship, a trend that the Galaxy S24 continues. The newer model uses the more durable Gorilla Glass Victus 2 as opposed to Gorilla Glass Victus Plus for the S22. Still, we'd suggest one of the best Galaxy S24 cases to keep your phone looking sharp should you end up upgrading.\n\nColors haven't evolved all that much over the years, with the Galaxy S24 coming in black, gray, violet and yellow options, along with three exclusive colors only available through Samsung (blue, green and orange, to be specific). That compares to black, white, green, rose gold and purple for the Galaxy S22.\n\nWinner: Galaxy S24\n\nSamsung shrunk the bezels around the Galaxy S24's display, which has made more screen space available on that model. The S24 features a 6.2-inch panel, compared to 6.1 inches on the Galaxy S22, even though both phones are about the same size. (The S24 is fractionally taller and wider, though you'd need microscopic vision to notice the difference.)\n\nThe more significant change has been to the brightness of the respective displays. When the Galaxy S22 debuted, it boasted a peak brightness of 1,300 nits. The Galaxy S24 ups that to 2,600 nits, and our testing reflects the improvement. Using a light meter, we registered 1,416 nits of brightness on the S24's screen, compared to 1,191 nits with the S22.\n\nThe Galaxy S24's screen is slightly more colorful than the panel on the Galaxy S22, with colors just about as accurate on both displays. A noteworthy improvement for the Galaxy S24 is that the refresh rate for the newer phone's display has a wider range. Like the S22's screen, the S24 panel can ramp up to 120Hz for smoother scrolling and more immersive gaming. But it can also slow down to 1Hz when activity is static, preserving battery life; the S22 can only drop to 48Hz.\n\nWinner: Galaxy S24\n\nSamsung made some major changes to the Galaxy S22 camera setup two years ago, replacing the 12MP sensor used for the main camera with a 50MP version. The sensor was larger, too, in order to let in more light and improve the quality of photos in less-favorable lighting conditions. The telephoto lens saw an improvement, too, as the Galaxy S22 traded a hybrid zoom for a 3x optical zoom.\n\nSince then, Samsung has kept the hardware changes to a minimum, as the Galaxy S24 uses the same 50MP/12MP/10MP setup for its main, ultrawide and telephoto cameras. (The front camera changed with the Galaxy S23 to become a 12MP shooter instead of the 10MP front camera on the S22.) Instead, Samsung has focused on changes to its photo-processing algorithms as a way to improve image quality.\n\nThe Galaxy S24 tends to produce darker, richer colors in my experience, and you can see that in this photo of some tulips and oranges. The oranges look the same in either photo, but the tulip petals are a much deeper shade of red in the Galaxy S24, making for a more striking shot. It also helps that the S24 keeps things in sharper focus as some of the petals on the left side of the image look a little less defined.\n\nWe see that same issue with shot composition in this image of some waffles topped with fruit. The lighting's not ideal, as there's some sunlight streaming in from the right side of the photo. The Galaxy S24 managed to keep the shot in balance, while a little over-exposure has crept into the S22 photo. See how washed out the coffee pot looks in the background of the S22's effort. Once again, sharper focus is on display in the S24 shot, as the S22 leaves some of the bananas looking fuzzy around the edges.\n\nI think the ultrawide cameras perform similarly, even if the S24 continues to favor darker colors. Here, the S22's lighter hand works to its advantage, as some of the more colorful houseboats pop out of the scene, and the water has a more mirror-like quality. I do think the iceplant in the foreground of the photo looks a little better with the S24's darker, richer coloring.\n\nThe Galaxy S22 continues to hold its own in this portrait shot, as the lighter colors make the statue stand out from the background. The Galaxy S24 also lets too much a shadow creep over the statue's face -- a problem that might not have popped up had I been photographing a live subject. That said, I do prefer the background blur of the Galaxy S24 photo, which indicates the improvements made to Samsung's photo processing algorithms over the years.\n\nThe Galaxy S24 really outperforms its predecessor in the dark -- surprising since the Nightography concept was first introduced with the Galaxy S22. Nevertheless, the S22 photo of two skeletons in an unlit basement is less focused when captured by the Galaxy S22. The S24 keeps the colors looking even, and you can make out more details in the background.\n\nIt's an even sharper contrast when I zoomed in by 3x -- something the Galaxy S24 is able to handle with aplomb thanks to the camera phone's Pro Visual Engine. Its photo is a little dark, but it looks more natural as opposed to the artificial cast the Galaxy S22 uses to lighten the scene.\n\nI don't think the Galaxy S24 vs. Galaxy S22 camera differences are all that substantial, but the S24 does edge the S22 out in terms of image quality. You could get by with the S22's cameras, but you'll get better overall shots with the newer phone.\n\nWinner: Galaxy S24\n\nYou always expect to see some performance improvement when comparing new phones with their predecessors, thanks to changes made to the system-on-chip powering the latest device. That's especially true of the Galaxy S24, which benefits from the advances Qualcomm made to its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 silicon. The new chipset is a much better performer than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 that's featured with the Galaxy S22. (Note that this applies to the North American releases of both phones; like the Galaxy S22, the Galaxy S24 uses an Exynos chipset for models released in other parts of the world.)\n\nThe Galaxy S24's single and multicore scores on Geekbench 6 are 2,235 and 6,922, respectively. Those are improvements of 35% and 87% over the Galaxy S22's results on those same tests. The Galaxy S24 also handles graphics much better, posting a result of 120.4 frames per second in 3DMark's Wild Life Unlimited benchmark. That's about double the 60-fps result of the Galaxy S22.\n\nImprovements were more modest in our real-world test, in which we use Adobe Premiere Rush to transcode a video. Still, the Galaxy S24 handled the task faster, taking 41 seconds to the S22's 47-second time. In other words, the gain in performance over the past two years should be something you notice when using the Galaxy S24.\n\nWinner: Galaxy S24\n\nThe improved Snapdragon chipset doesn't just help boost performance on the Galaxy S24 -- it also helps the newer phone last longer.\n\nFor all its strengths, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 was not known for its power efficiency, and the battery test results of the Galaxy S22 reflected that. When we had that phone surf the web over cellular, it ran out of power after 7 hours and 51 minutes, which was a little more than 2 hours shorter than the average phone's result.\n\nIt is safe to say the Galaxy S24 improves upon that result. The new phone lasted 13 hours and 28 minutes or around 5.5 hours longer than the S22. Yes, the S24 has a bigger battery at 4,000 mAh to the 3,700 mAh power pack inside the Galaxy S22. But that only explains some of the improvement -- the rest goes to the better power management features Qualcomm has added to its silicon.\n\nBoth the Galaxy S22 and Galaxy S24 charge at the same 25W speed when using a wired connection. But you'll be turning to a charger far less often with the Galaxy S24, as it's earned a spot on our best phone battery life list.\n\nWinner: Galaxy S24\n\nWe've talked about the significant improvements to battery life and overall performance over the last two years. But it may be the software capabilities of these two phones that are the most different.\n\nOn paper, that shouldn't be the case, as the Galaxy S22 is now running Android 14, which came preinstalled on the Galaxy S24. But the S24 has something the S22 doesn't -- AI-powered features that simplify a lot of common smartphone tasks.\n\nIf you want to search for something on the Galaxy S24, all you have to do is circle an image of it, and a Google results window will pop up in your current app. You can also have AI auto-format your notes, summarize your audio recordings and even help you move around objects in photos you're editing. None of these capabilities are available to the Galaxy S22, and they're not likely to appear via software update.\n\nSpeaking of updates, the Galaxy S22 made waves by extending support to four years of Android updates with an extra year of security support. At the time, that was the best support available to an Android device, but that's child's play to the Galaxy S24. Samsung's new phone will receive software and security support for the next seven years, so you'll be able to hold on to this device for as long as you want.\n\nWinner: Galaxy S24\n\nNo one would really expect the Galaxy S22 to top the Galaxy S24 in any category. You'd expect there to be improvements over the course of two years, and in that respect, the Galaxy S24 does not disappoint. It's the size of the gap between the two phones that raises eyebrows.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 vs. Galaxy S22 camera comparisons are probably the closest when we stack these two phones up against one another, with the S24 enjoying a slight edge. It's the other areas where Samsung's new phone is clearly the better option -- by leaps and by bounds when it comes to battery life and performance, thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset. And the Galaxy AI features make any software comparison a no-contest.\n\nI'm a big believer in going as long as possible between phone upgrades. But it's very clear that switching from a Galaxy S22 to an S24 will be a big improvement in several key areas. You just get a better experience overall with the latest Samsung flagship.",

It's rare to see an OLED of this size going at such a low price, never mind that it's a QD-OLED for bright and vivid colors alongside bright highlights and deep blacks for remarkable HDR quality.\n\nIf you're working on a modest home theater where you can draw the curtains and get cozy with a few friends, this 48-inch LG A2 is a great option. It's not the brightest TV in the world, but this deal makes it an especially affordable OLED option. The unbeatable contrast of OLED alongside its wide color gamut make for a splendid image as long as the viewing conditions are right.\n\nBig TVs get big savings, and this 85-incher from Samsung has $400 cut off the price to let you get it for under $2,000. It takes advantage of quality-boosting features like full array backlighting and quantum dots for wide color and rich contrast. Samsung also has a feature that will let you combine the TV's speakers with a Samsung soundbar for massive audio to match the screen.\n\nAfter a 55-inch TV that doesn't become an eyesore when it's powered down? That's the problem Samsung answered with The Frame, a TV that turns into framed artwork when it's not in use. An anti-glare finish helps obscure the fact it's a TV when it's displaying art, and swappable frames can help it blend in with your decor.\n\nTCL already had value in the bag with the QM850G, delivering a capable TV with quantum dot-driven color, 2300 local dimming zones, and a 120Hz refresh rate all at an impressive price. A deal never hurts though, and this one lets you take $200 off the 65-inch model to get a whole lot of TV for just over $1,000.\n\nYou don't have to miss out on premium qualities if you don't want to go with a massive TV. The Hisense U6K offers great color and contrast at an attractive price for the 55-inch model. For a sub-$500 TV, the Hisense U6K delivers commendable quality. At $400, it's a steal.\n\nLG's C series of OLED TVs have been a hot option for years now, and the C3 is a powerful option with all the glory of OLED on display. The C3 is brighter than its predecessors, helping sort out one of OLEDs' long-standing weaknesses. The TV also has a fast refresh rate that makes it as useful for gamers as it is for cinephiles. This deal lets you grab a modest, 48-inch model for just $1,000.\n\nYou can snag this powerful MacBook Pro model with the wonderfully powerful M3 Pro chip for $200 off in this deal. The laptop matches speedy performance with long-lasting battery life and offers an exceptional display.\n\nBest Buy has plenty of TVs ready for gaming on, and this $50 discount on the Xbox Series X can help you take advantage of those TVs' capabilities. The powerful console supports up to 4K/120Hz output for sharp and fluid gaming.\n\nTrying to tune out? The AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) offer up improved sound and powerful noise canceling so you can enjoy your music unbothered by what's around you. While they're normally a bit pricey, this deal makes them far more appealing.\n\nHi-Fi listening and powerful noise canceling are on deck with the AirPods Max. These comfortable headphones offer an excellent listening experience for iPhone, iPad and Mac users. And while their price is a hard pill to swallow, this deal cuts a sizable chunk off to make it much more digestible.\n\nWhile the 13-inch M1 MacBook Air is a strong value, the 15-inch M2 MacBook Air provides more power and more screen for those who need it all while continuing to offer a thin and light package for portability. And this deal makes it an excellent value.\n\nApple's base iPad generally offers great value with powerful performance, a delightful screen, and deep integration into the rest of the Apple ecosystem. Even at $449, the 10th Gen iPad was a compelling option, but this $100 discount just drives up the value.\n\nThe Pixel 8 Pro is Google's most capable phone to date, and while the $1000 starting price was a disappointing increase over the prior year's model, this discount turns the tides. At $800, the Pixel 8 Pro is a brilliant option with modest performance and excellent cameras.\n\nEven the best TVs rarely have audio that's on the same level as their video, so with so many good TV deals, a suitable soundbar pairing is great. And that's just the Samsung HW-Q930C. This setup puts an incredible soundbar at the forefront with stunning surround capabilities all on its own. But the bar further pairs with a robust subwoofer and a pair of rear satellite speakers to really boost the sound. It's not surprising that the setup normally costs $1,400. What is surprising is that Best Buy has it for 50% off.\n\nThis Underscored-approved gadget wins serious points for keeping your cup of joe toasty for as long as you need it to be using the accompanying app -- and coming in the cutest giftable colorways.\n\n$120 at Best Buy\n\nKeurig K-Select Single-Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker\n\nCoffee pods are some of the most convenient methods of getting your caffeine fix, so this highly rated Keurig coffee maker will surely become a countertop fixture that also makes for a great gift.\n\n$120 at Best Buy\n\nNinja Professional Plus Blender Duo With Auto-IQ\n\nFor creamy smoothies, dips and sauces at record speeds, opt for our favorite budget-friendly blender with an impressive 1,400W of power, a large 72-ounce pitcher and numerous manual settings for the perfect texture each time.\n\n$120 at Best Buy\n\nNespresso Lattissima One Original Espresso Machine With Milk Frother\n\nOur favorite Nespresso machine with a built-in milk frother will transport you right to a nonna- and nonno-owned street corner caf\u00e9. You'll get gourmet beverages with the click of a button.\n\n$321 at Best Buy\n\nInstant Pot Rio Wide Plus 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker\n\nYour kitchen countertops need a pressure cooker -- no pressure, of course. But with several cooking functions, a lightning-quick cooking speed and a large capacity for easy meal prep, the wider version of our go-to budget electric pressure cooker is a no-brainer investment.\n\nThis large-capacity air fryer oven punches far above its weight by serving as 10 appliances in one. An intuitive digital touchscreen and easy-to-clean drip trays and racks make it a sensible cooking tool for busy schedules.\n\nGone are the days of toasters that simply tackle bread.

It has everything from AI technology that supports your unique fabrics to an automatic detergent dispenser.\n\n$1,950 at Best Buy\n\nWhirlpool High-Efficiency Smart Top-Load Washer and Electric Dryer\n\nNot only do top-load washer-dryers tend to have shorter cycle times but they usually produce less mold buildup.

Check out the full list below.\n\nThe Best HP President's Day Gaming DealsHP OMEN 16 RTX 4060 Gaming Laptop for $1099.99\n\nThe HP OMEN 16 laptop features an Intel Core i7-13700HX CPU and RTX 4060 GPU. The Intel Core i7-13700HX has a max turbo frequency of 5GHz and 16 cores and 24 threads. The mobile RTX 4060 GPU sits right in between the RTX 3070 and RTX 3070 Ti. This is a very capable, current generation GPU that can easily run games on the native 1080p display even at high or maximum settings.\n\nHP OMEN 16 RTX 4070 Gaming Laptop for $1349.99\n\nThis laptop is upgraded with a sharper 16\" 2560x1440 display, a more powerful GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, and double the SSD capacity. The RTX 4070 mobile GPU performs on par with the RTX 3080.\n\nHP OMEN Transcend 16 RTX 4070 Gaming Laptop for $1429.99\n\nThe OMEN Transcend 16 is the newest gaming laptop from HP. It's thinner and lighter than the original OMEN laptops (0.78\" vs 0.91\" and 4.6lbs vs 5.1lbs) but since the internal components are identical, the performance isn't compromised in any way. For example, many slimmer gaming laptops opt for a low voltage CPU, but not the OMEN Transcend. This laptop is equipped with a fully powered Intel Core i7-13700HX, the same chip you'll find in regular sized gaming laptops, and a GeForce RTX 4070 GPU with close to the maximum TGP of 130W. No gimped components to be found here.\n\nHP OMEN 45L Intel Core i9 RTX 4090 PC for $3179.99\n\nThe 2022 OMEN 45L is HP's flagship gaming PC. This is HP's roomiest chassis with plenty of cooling in the form of three 120mm fans for system airflow and a liquid cooled CPU. This PC is also equipped with an efficient 800W 80PLUS Gold power supply and current-gen components like an Intel Z790 motherboard, Kingston FURY DDR5 RGB memory modules, and a WD Black SSD. The RTX 4090 is far and away the most powerful video card you can get right now, leaving competitors like AMD's latest Radeon RX 7900 XTX in the dust. It's also ridiculously more powerful than any of the RTX 30 series cards: it's up to 90% faster than the 3080 Ti. The 4090 is the one and only solution to ray-traced 4K gaming at consistent 60+fps.\n\nHP OMEN 45L AMD Ryzen 5 RTX 4060 Ti PC for $1249.99\n\nThis is a great price for any RTX 4060 Ti gaming PC, but this particular PC is installed in HP's flagship OMEN 45L chassis with a 360mm all-in-one liquid cooling system and a beefy 800W 80PLUS power supply. There's plenty of room here for upgrades, whether it be through HP's website or on your own down the road.\n\nWhy Choose an HP Gaming PC?\n\nComparatively speaking, HP usually has the best prices compared to similar models from Lenovo and Dell. You also get free shipping on all all computer purchases as well as the industry standard 1 year warranty. The HP OMEN line of gaming PCs and laptops feature great aesthetics, premium build quality, and powerful components.

        "title": "Xbox Game Pass Ultimate: Everything You Need To Know - February 2024",
        "content": "Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is one of Microsoft's biggest achievements in gaming. Its continued success proves that there is a space in the market for what the service offers. And, most gamers who have tried it and/or subscribed to it will tell you it's a really good value. But what exactly is Xbox Game Pass Ultimate?\n\nIn this handy guide, we break down the details no matter how small. What you get out of it, how much it costs, what games are included. Even what devices are compatible. All of these things are discussed and all of them are important things to know before you decide to take the leap. And the best part about Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is that you don't even need an Xbox console. Which makes the service a whole lot more accessible to gamers.\n\nXbox Game Pass Ultimate is the best version of Game Pass. It's the ultimate tier, one might say. For a reasonable monthly fee, you get access to a pretty large rotating library of games.\n\nYou can play these games on your console or other devices. And it even comes with all of the benefits of the PC Game Pass. This includes Game Pass Core (for console) too, which is similar to PlayStation Plus but for Xbox. As the name implies, this service is a pass to play games. And you can play them as much as you want throughout the entire month. As long as your subscription is active of course.\n\nThe only time you can't play a game is if Microsoft ends up pulling it from the library. Which it does consistently as it cycles games in and out on an almost monthly basis. That being said, most games do stick around for multiple months before being pulled.\n\nThere are a few different plans to choose from when it comes to Game Pass. But this is about Xbox Game Pass Ultimate so we'll be focusing on that price. As well as what you get for it.\n\nXbox Game Pass Ultimate costs $16.99 a month. If you're a first-time subscriber though, you get the first month for only $1. Which means you end up saving $50 over the course of three months. After that 90 days is up your monthly subscription fee goes up to $16.99.\n\nYou can also subscribe to Game Pass for PC which costs $9.99 a month but comes with way fewer features. It's well worth paying the extra $5 to get the complete package. Additionally, you have the option of getting two different console plans. First, there's Xbox Game Pass Core. This is just Xbox Live Gold and Microsoft simply changed the name to better align with the service. This is still $9.99 a month. Then there's just Xbox Game Pass Console, which is $10.99 a month but gives you most of the same features as Xbox Game Pass PC.\n\nThe one difference between the PC and Console plans, aside from the $1 per month, is that PC Game Pass comes with the EA Play membership. Game Pass Console does not. If you want that included on console, you will need to go with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Again, though, it's worth it, since Ultimate also comes with access to games the day they release. Which games will vary on a case-by-case basis. As Microsoft doesn't throw every single game into this.\n\nMicrosoft has now confirmed that pricing for Xbox Game Pass will increase for most markets. This includes the US. Pricing is going up for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Console Game Pass, but not PC Game Pass. The new prices will be $16.99 a month and $10.99 a month respectively.\n\nPricing changes begin on July 6 for new subscribers, and on August 13 for existing subscribers.\n\nDoes Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offer any perks?\n\nThere are definitely some perks if you sign up for Ultimate. Not the least of which is the ability to play games on both PC and Xbox. As well as stream games to mobile and PC so you can play in the cloud.\n\nSome of the more recent perks include a three-month trial to Calm which you can use on both your Android and iOS devices, as well as on smartwatches and other devices. There are also perks for in-game content in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, PUBG, Apex Legends, and more. Microsoft is even throwing in trials to Paramount+, and a free season of certain shows like Boruto: Naruto Next Generations that you can watch in your Microsoft Movies and TV library.\n\nIn short, check out the perks section of the Game Pass app wherever you access Game Pass. Because there's some really good stuff in there that you don't want to pass up.\n\nWhere is Xbox Game Pass Ultimate available?\n\nMicrosoft has launched the service in a wide variety of countries across the globe. Including the US, the UK, Argentina, Australia, and Austria. The full list also includes Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nWhile this isn't every single region around the globe, it's quite a lot. Which is a pretty big advantage for those wanting some form of cloud gaming. You can check the full list of supported countries here. Simply scroll along the side panel with the list of country names and find yours, then click on it and check the panel to the left where it says if Xbox Game Pass services are available or not. It will tell you which plans are available as well. For instance, PC Game Pass is available in Albania but none of the other options are.\n\nWhat features does Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offer?\n\nThe biggest and most well-known feature is that you get access to more than 100 high-quality games. You can play them on both the PC and on your Xbox console.\n\nYou can download these games to either of those devices. And it'll be just like if you purchased them from the store. The only difference is that you only have access to them for as long as your subscription is active. Or as long as Microsoft keeps them on the roster.\n\nIn addition to being able to download all those games, you can also stream them to your Android smartphone using the cloud gaming feature. This will work on both mobile data and Wi-Fi. However, Wi-Fi will probably provide the most reliable experience.\n\nXbox Game Pass Ultimate also allows you access to new and upcoming Xbox games. And on the same day as the release of the console version no less.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there, because Microsoft has more to give. You also get special member discounts on games. As well as in-game content perks, and free memberships to both Game Pass Core and EA Play. Game Pass Core (previously Xbox Live Gold) is a monthly membership where you get at least one free game every month for your console. Plus it enables online play.\n\nEA Play is kind of like Game Pass, but all the games are from EA. So you get access to titles like Madden, Need For Speed, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and more.\n\nYou can access Xbox Game Pass Ultimate from your Xbox One, Xbox One X, Xbox One S, Xbox Series X, or Xbox Series S console. You can also access it from your PC, and from your Android smartphone or tablet if you're playing games in the cloud. All Windows PCs will be compatible so long as they're running a more current version of Windows.\n\nAnd the same thing goes for Android smartphones and tablets. As long as it's a semi-current phone with a fairly up-to-date version of Android, you can play Xbox games in the cloud through the Game Pass app.\n\nMicrosoft also expanded cloud gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to iOS devices and PC. Access through those two device types was rolled out to users in a limited closed beta on April 20, 2021. Invites to test the service in the closed beta began rolling out on April 20 and continued to roll out to new devices over time.\n\nWithin the next few weeks, the cloud gaming service of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will be available for Windows 10 PC browsers, Mac, and iOS outside of beta. You can also find Xbox Game Pass on Samsung TVs and monitors with Samsung Gaming Hub and on some LG TV models.\n\nThere are a ton of different games available in the service. For starters, you can play Halo 5: Guardians, Gears 5, Ori and The Blind Forest, Ori and The Will of The Wisps, Control, Torchlight III, and many others.\n\nAnd those are just some of the games that are included regularly. There are also a ton of games from EA thanks to the inclusion of EA Play, which adds games like Madden, the Sims 4, and other top EA titles. Microsoft also added tons of games from Bethesda following the acquisition, including The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, DOOM Eternal, Fallout 4, Fallout 76, and more.\n\nThere's also Sea Of Thieves, Star Wars Battlefront and Star Wars Battlefront II, Destiny 2, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, Battlefield V, Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition, and many, many more. If you're interested in seeing the entire library of games, you can do so from the Xbox Game Pass app, or by visiting the games page for the service which has them all listed.\n\nAs of March 31, 2021, Microsoft also added backward-compatible titles to the cloud gaming collection. This includes both The Elder Scrolls III and IV, Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie, Double Dragon Neon, and more.\n\nYou can see all 16 titles added here, and more backward-compatible titles are planned for the near future. Microsoft also made online multiplayer for free-to-play games available at no charge back on April 21, the day after the closed beta went live for iOS and PC users for cloud gaming.\n\nSome of the most recent titles added to Xbox Game Pass include Signalis, Gunfire Reborn, and one of our personal favorites, Frog Detective: The Entire Mystery. There's also Persona 5 Royal, Amnesia Rebirth, Amnesia Collection, SOMA, Scorn, Chivalry II, High On Life, Rainbow Billy: The Curse of The Leviathan, Potion Craft, League Of Legends, Valorant, Legends of Runeterra, Teamfight Tactics, Chained Echoes, Hello Neighbor 2, LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, Eastward, Totally Reliable Delivery Service, The Walking Dead: The Final Season, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, and Soccer Story.\n\nOther recent titles include Atomic Heart, Shadow Warrior 3: Definitive Edition, Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord, Madden 23, SD Gundam Battle Alliance, Hot Wheels Unleashed, Darkest Dungeon, Inkulinati, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R, Hi-Fi Rush, Ni No Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, Civilization VI, Guilty Gear - Strive -, F1 22, Soul Hackers, Merge & Blade, Eastern Exorcist, Ghostlore, Planet of Lana, Cassette Beats, Massive Chalice, Railway Empire 2, and Chicory: A Colorful Tale.\n\nSome of the newest releases on Xbox Game Pass include Persona 3 Reload, A Little to The Left, Plate Up!, Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, the Resident Evil 3 remake, Madden NFL 24, Brotato, Palworld, and quite a few others. After the Activision Blizzard acquisition was finalized late last year, Microsoft is finally going to be adding the first Blizzard game into the mix. This will be Diablo IV which is coming in March.\n\nSometimes Microsoft will remove games from the library. As noted things are on a rotating list of sorts.\n\nWhile many games will be available in Game Pass Ultimate for quite a long time, and some have been there since the beginning, many will also rotate out. Usually, the ones that leave are the new releases that are offered to Game Pass Ultimate members on the day of release.\n\nAnd sometimes the games that leave are titles that have simply been there a while, not getting much play time.\n\nHere's what games you'll want to play before they leave the Game Pass catalog soon.\n\nDoes Xbox Game Pass Ultimate have cloud gaming for PC or console?\n\nFor a while cloud gaming was only available on mobile, then Microsoft eventually added it to PC. It's now available across mobile, PC, and even Xbox consoles or TVs and monitors from LG and Samsung. So you can play Xbox games in the cloud in lots of places and on lots of devices. You'll even find some Xbox games available through NVIDIA's GeForce NOW service because of the partnership between the two companies.\n\nDo Xbox Game Pass Ultimate games support achievements?\n\nYes. Every game on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will support achievements. And no matter where you play your games, whether it be on PC, on an Xbox console, or on your Android smartphone or tablet, the achievements will count towards your Xbox account.\n\nAs you have to sign into your Xbox account to access the service in the first place. This means you can acquire achievements on one device and they'll be there the next time you play on your console.\n\nDoes Xbox Game Pass Ultimate support multiplayer modes?\n\nYes. All games included that have multiplayer modes will allow you to play them. So if you're itching to hook up with a friend and play some Star Wars Battlefront II, you'll be able to do just that.",

        "title": "Phone Comparisons: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 vs HONOR Magic V2",
        "content": "The HONOR Magic V2 was one of the most talked-about, if not the most talked about foldable smartphones in the last couple of months. How does it stack up to probably the best-known one? Well, that's what we're here to find out. In this article, we'll be comparing the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 vs HONOR Magic V2. The very best foldable smartphone from Samsung vs the best from HONOR.\n\nIf you have the option of getting the HONOR Magic V2, now that it's available outside of China, this may interest you. HONOR really made true strides with the hardware, and the difference truly is interesting. We'll first check out their specifications side by side, and will then move to compare them across a number of other categories. We'll compare the two phones' designs, displays, performance, battery life, cameras, and audio performance.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 & HONOR Magic V2, respectively\n\n- Screen size (main):\n\n7.6-inch Foldable Dynamic AMOLED 2X display (120Hz, HDR10+, 1,750 nits)\n\n7.92-inch Foldable LTPO OLED (120Hz, HDR10+, IMAX Enhanced, 1,600 nits)\n\n- Screen Size (cover):\n\n6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X (120Hz, 1,750 nits)\n\n6.43-inch LTPO OLED (120Hz, 2,500 nits)\n\n- Display resolution (main):\n\n1812 x 2176\n\n2156 x 2344\n\n- Display resolution (cover):\n\n2316 x 904\n\n2376 x 1060\n\n- SoC:\n\nQualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy\n\nQualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2\n\n- RAM:\n\n256GB/512GB/1TB (UFS 4.0)\n\n16GB (LPDDR5X)\n\n- Storage:\n\n512GB (UFS 4.0)\n\n256GB/512GB/1TB (UFS 4.0)\n\n- Rear cameras:\n\n50MP (wide, f/1.8 aperture, Dual Pixel PDAF OIS), 12MP (ultrawide, 123-degree FoV), 10MP (telephoto, 3x optical zoom)\n\n50MP (wide, f/1.9 aperture, PDAF, OIS, Laser AF), 50MP (ultrawide), 20MP (telephoto, 2.5x optical zoom, OIS, PDAF)\n\n- Front cameras:\n\n4MP (under display, main display, f/1.8 aperture), 10MP (cover display, f/2.2 aperture)\n\n16MP (wide, f/2.2 aperture)\n\n- Battery:\n\n4,400mAh\n\n5,000mAh\n\n- Charging:\n\n25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless (no charger)\n\n66W wired, 5W reverse wired (charger included)\n\n- Dimensions (unfolded):\n\n154.9 x 129.9 x 6.1mm\n\n156.7 x 145.4 x 4.7-4.8mm\n\n- Dimensions (folded):\n\n154.9 x 67.1 x 13.4mm\n\n156.7 x 74.1 x 9.9-10.1mm\n\n- Weight:\n\n253 grams\n\n231/237 grams\n\n- Connectivity:\n\n5G, LTE, NFC, Wi-Fi, USB Type-C, Bluetooth 5.3\n\n- Security:\n\nSide-facing fingerprint scanner\n\n- OS:\n\nAndroid 13 with One UI\n\nAndroid 13 with MagicOS 7.2\n\n- Price:\n\n$1,799+\n\n\u20ac1,999\n\n- Buy:\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 (Samsung)\n\nHONOR Magic V2 (HONOR)\n\nBoth of these devices are made out of aluminum and glass. The HONOR Magic V2 also comes in a variant with a vegan leather backplate. These two phones do feel entirely different in the hand. The HONOR Magic V2 is a much thinner and considerably lighter smartphone. That's actually one of its main advantages over any other foldable. It's the thinnest and lightest inwards-folding large-format foldable in the market.\n\nThe HONOR Magic V2 measures only 4.7-4.8mm when unfolded, and 9.9-10.1mm when folded. The Galaxy Z Fold 5, on the other hand, measures 6.1mm when unfolded, and 13.4mm when unfolded. The Magic V2 weighs 231 grams or 237 grams, depending on the model. The vegan leather variant is lighter. The Galaxy Z Fold 5, on the other hand, weighs 253 grams. That is a difference you will feel in the hand, that's for sure.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 5 also has a very narrow cover display, narrower than any other regular smartphone. The HONOR Magic V2, on the other hand, has a regular cover display width, thus it's more useful as a regular smartphone (when unfolded). Furthermore, the crease on the Magic V2's display is very well maintained, while that's not the case with the Galaxy Z Fold 5. Both smartphones do fold flat, however.\n\nYou will find three cameras on the back of both phones, though those camera islands do look a bit different. The cameras are vertically aligned on both devices. The power/lock key also doubles as a fingerprint scanner on both of these smartphones. Samsung's foldable does have the advantage of offering an IPX8 water resistance rating, while the Magic V2 doesn't have any such rating.\n\nThe HONOR Magic V2 actually feels like a regular smartphone when you're holding it in its folded form. When you're using it too, it's probably the first smartphone that can say that for itself. That's definitely not the case with the Galaxy Z Fold 5.\n\nBoth phones include two displays, one foldable, and one non-foldable. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 features a 7.6-inch 1812 x 2176 Foldable Dynamic AMOLED 2X panel as its main display. That display has a refresh rate of 120Hz, and it supports HDR10+ content. It also has a 6.2-inch cover display which offers a resolution of 2316 x 904 pixels. That is a Dynamic AMOLED 2X panel with a 120Hz refresh rate. The maximum brightness of these displays is 1,750 nits. Corning's Gorilla Glass 2 protection is used here.\n\nThe HONOR Magic V2, on the other hand, has a 7.92-inch 2156 x 2344 Foldable LTPO OLED display for its main panel. That panel can project up to 1 billion colors, and it has a 120Hz refresh rate. This display does support HDR10+ content, and it's IMAX Enhanced. It has a peak brightness of 1,600 nits. The cover display measures 6.43 inches, and it's an LTPO OLED display. It can also project up to 1 billion colors, its refresh rate also goes up to 120Hz, and it also supports HDR10+ content. This panel has a max brightness of 2,500 nits, and it's protected by the nanocrystal glass 2.0.\n\nI have to say that all four displays are actually really good. They are vivid, have great viewing angles, and they are also more than sharp enough. They do get bright enough as well, and neither main display feels too plasticky or anything of the sort. It is worth noting that the HONOR Magic V2 has a much less noticeable crease on its main display, though, it's not even close. Also, its cover panel has a more \"normal\" aspect ratio, though some of you may prefer the very narrow ratio of the Galaxy Z Fold 5's cover display.\n\nBoth of these phones are fueled by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC, but the Galaxy Z Fold 5 has the overclocked version. The Galaxy Z Fold 5 also includes 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0 flash storage. The HONOR Magic V2 sports 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0 flash storage as well. The Magic V2 does have more RAM, while the Galaxy Z Fold 5 has higher clock speeds, but in order to performance-related hardware, they're on the same playing field, pretty much.\n\nThey do show their power when it comes to performance. Both smartphones do deliver great performance with no lag or anything of the sort. An occasional stutter is present, but that's pretty much it. Truth be said, we did notice that those happen a bit more frequently on the Galaxy Z Fold 5. HONOR's MagicOS 7.2 may not be the most modern-looking skin, but it does offer really smooth performance. They both do a fantastic job when it comes to regular, everyday performance, regardless of what you're doing. They're great for multitasking, though the Galaxy Z Fold 5 has more features that take advantage of its main display. We've enjoyed using it for multitasking a bit more.\n\nIn terms of gaming, both of these phones do a really good job. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 may not be the best chip Qualcomm has to offer at this point, but it's not far from it. Even games like Genshin Impact run really well on both of these phones, so if you're planning to use them for gaming, that's perfectly fine. They both do get quite warm if you push them with games, but we did not notice any drops in gaming quality after 30-60 minutes of intense gaming. Neither phone got too hot to handle either.\n\nSamsung's handset includes a 4,400mAh battery, while the HONOR Magic V2 features a 5,000mAh battery. HONOR is using a more advanced silicon-carbon battery in its phone, which explains how the company managed to fit such a huge unit in such a compact body. Is the battery life any good, though? Well, they both offer good battery life, but the HONOR Magic V2 does have an edge, at least that was the case for us.\n\nWe were able to get up to 7 hours of screen-on-time on the Galaxy Z Fold 5, but very rarely. It was more like 6-6.5 hours, depending on the day. The HONOR Magic V2 is capable of going over the 7-hour mark on a regular basis, without a problem. Do note that this is based on our mixed usage, with no gaming involved on those days, or very light gaming. We did not baby either phone, and have used them both under Wi-Fi and mobile internet, but mostly under Wi-Fi... for context's sake.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 5 supports 25W wired, 15W wireless, and 4.5W reverse wireless charging. The HONOR Magic V2, on the flip side, has support for 66W wired charging and 5W reverse wired charging. Do note that only the HONOR Magic V2 comes with a charger in the box, the Galaxy Z Fold 5 does not. Also, the Magic V2 does charge a lot faster in comparison, though it lacks wireless charging.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 features a 50-megapixel main camera, a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera (123-degree FoV), and a 10-megapixel telephoto camera (3x optical zoom). The HONOR Magic V2, on the flip side, has a 50-megapixel main camera, a 50-megapixel ultrawide unit, and a 20-megapixel telephoto camera (2.5x optical zoom). The results that these cameras offer are different, though.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 5 likes to add a bit more saturation to images, while both phones tend to prefer to offer brighter rather than more color-accurate photos. Images during the day are sharp and nice-looking from both phones, though they both can push things a bit too far when it comes to saturation. During the night the Magic V2 tends to brighten up images a bit more, but both of them like lighter photos in lower light with brightened shadows. Ultrawide cameras are good on both phones, while the ones from the Magic V2 do provide a bit more detail, and keep up with the main camera a bit more overall.\n\nTelephoto images look good on both sides, though nothing truly special in all honestly. The differences between telephoto images and the main ones are kind of obvious, especially when the light goes away. All in all, neither phone offers the very best camera performance, but both are really good, and the vast majority of people won't really care about the difference, in all honesty. Video performance, on the other hand, is good on both, but nothing to write home about. It's above average, but not outstanding.\n\nWhen it comes to speakers, both phones offer stereo setups. The ones on the Galaxy Z Fold 5 are tuned by AKG, and the loudness both smartphones provide is good. Both sets of speakers are also well-balanced, though the ones from the Galaxy Z Fold 5 do provide a bit more oomph.\n\nIf you were hoping to get an audio jack on either of these two phones, well, you'll be disappointed. Neither phone offers it, but you can always utilize their Type-C ports for audio connections. Both phones also come with Bluetooth 5.3 support for wireless audio.",

        "content": "Wrestling games might seem to focus more on theatrical presentation, but these ten games featured some of the best gameplay mechanics of the genre.\n\nWrestling games like the WWE 2K series are a unique sub-genre of fighting and sports games. They do not fall into the fighting game category like Tekken or a Street Fighter game, but lack the strictness of sports combat titles like UFC, Fight Night, and Undisputed.\n\nGAMERANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThe perfect wrestling game needs to capture the entertainment and theatrical side of the business, while the gameplay needs to be strategic but fun and represent the technical side of the action on TV. For many fans, small details in the gameplay mechanics matter, if not more so than the presentation. This list focuses on wrestling games with the best mechanics and gameplay to replicate the in-ring action of the televised product.\n\nUpdated February 16, 2024, by Michael Llewellyn: With the upcoming WWE 2K24 getting closer, fans are excited to see what the latest entry in the WWE 2K series brings. With the promise of new mechanics and its top-notch presentation, it has the potential to be one of the best wrestling games available by building on the already established gameplay of its predecessors. This list has been updated to include more games that have wrestling-focused gameplay and features that make them stand the test of time.\n\nRelated WWE 2K23: The Best Finishers, Ranked (& How To Perform Them) WWE 2K23 has many amazing finishers; Here's how to perform some of the best.\n\n15 AEW: Fighter Forever\n\nYukes Returns To Develop The First AEW Wrestling Game\n\nAEW Fight Forever\n\nPlatform(s) PC , PS5 , PS4 , Switch , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S , Xbox One Released June 29, 2023 Developer(s) Yuke's See at Playstation Store\n\nAEW Fight Forever is the first wrestling game from the wrestling company. They hired former WWE game developer Yukes and teamed up with WWE No Mercy director Hideyuki Iwashita to head the project. The game was touted as a spiritual successor to AKI-developed wrestling, and fan expectations were high. Unfortunately, it disappointed many, as it leans into arcade-style wrestling gameplay more than the WCW and WWE games developed by AKI. It lacks the crawl mechanic when trapped in submission holds. Reversals and counter moves feel limited by comparison, and matches are over too quickly because the button-mashing kick-out system isn't as good.\n\nWhile AEW Fight Forever doesn't carry the standard set by AKI and WWE No Mercy, it does have a fun and fluid wrestling system that feels smoother than the WWE 2K games. Moreover, tag team and battle royale matches are superior. The chaos and speed feel reminiscent of the WWE Smackdown! Here Comes The Pain. AEW Fight Forever has the foundations to become a solid wrestling series if they focus on wrestling instead of violence.\n\n14 WWE 2K14\n\nA Packed Showcase Mode With An Excellent Roster And Fun Gameplay\n\nLaunched: 2013 Developer: Yukes Platform: PS3 and Xbox 360\n\nWWE 2K14 was the last title on the PS3/Xbox 360 generation consoles, and is arguably the best on those platforms. While the AI is a bit of a letdown, it featured several wrestling gameplay mechanics that fans appreciated. Wrestlers can crawl to the ropes when trapped in a submission, and they can target limbs with the R1/RB. It has chain grappling, and it introduced catapult catch finishers off the ropes.\n\nMoreover, WWE 2K14 features 30 Years Of WrestleMania Showcase mode, which has far more WrestleMania matches than WWE 2K24. WWE 2K24 has 21 WrestleMania Showcase matches, but WWE 2K14 has 47, covering the Hulkamania era, The New Generation, The Attitude Era, Ruthless Aggression, and The Universe Era. It has one of the most packed rosters of legends ever seen, with Hulk Hogan, Goldberg, Scott Steiner, Bruno Sammartino, Sgt Slaughter, Ultimate Warrior, Macho Man, King Kong Bundy, and more.\n\n13 WWE Day Of Reckoning\n\nA Solid Wrestling Title With a Lackluster Roster\n\nLaunched: 2004 Developer: Yukes Platform: GameCube\n\nA follow-up to Nintendo's exclusive, WWE WrestleMania 19, Day of Reckoning played differently from the Smackdown games on the PlayStation 2. It features an engine similar to the N64 AKI-developed games and improved visuals. The only thing that lets the gameplay down is the hit detection and clipping issues, but mechanically, it was a better game in the ring than its PS2 counterparts.\n\nPlayers can target specific body parts, and Day of Reckoning features a debut mechanic called the Momentum Shift. This feature allowed severely weakened wrestlers to escape finishing moves and more. It recognized the need for momentum in matches instead of endlessly hitting big maneuvers without consequences or fear of losing stamina. Unfortunately, it has one of the worst rosters for fans of WWE, and the story mode is terrible. It's hard to look past those issues, even if the gameplay is solid.\n\n12 WWE 2K16\n\nA Return To Form After WWE 2K15\n\nWWE 2K16\n\nPlatform(s) PC , PS3 , PS4 , Xbox 360 , Xbox One Released October 27, 2015 Developer(s) Yuke's , Visual Concepts\n\nBefore WWE 2K20 almost derailed the series, WWE 2K16 was another comeback story for the series after the dreadful WWE 2K15. It introduced chain wrestling, improved AI, and matches felt more back and forth than previous games.\n\nIt was let down by still feeling clunky and slow and wasn't a step up in animations from the PS3 games. Wrestlers got themselves into awkward positions, and the reversals felt off somehow. Yet it was still a great wrestling game that included Sting, Mr. Perfect, and one of the best Showcase modes in the series' history, focusing on Stone Cold Steve Austin, covering a significant proportion of the Attitude Era.\n\n11 WCW Vs. World\n\nThe PS1 Predecessor To The N64 AKI Wrestling Games\n\nLaunched: 1997 Developer: AKI Corporation Platform: PS1\n\nWCW vs. The World was the debut wrestling title from AKI - formally Man Breeze - on the PlayStation in the US in 1997. It was launched in Japan a year prior as Virtual Pro Wrestling and featured a roster of New Japan Pro Wrestling and some WCW stars. However, when the game was released in the West, the Japanese names were changed due to copyright laws despite retaining their likenesses.\n\nSo, even though it was marketed as a WCW game, it was very much a Japanese title. Being a Japanese wrestling game at its heart, WCW vs. The World was all about the gameplay and being as close to a 3D wrestling sim as the PS1 could get, unlike the faster but more arcade-style WWE Smackdown titles that launched later on the system. Like WWE 2K22 is for the series moving forward, this was the foundation for the popular engine used by the AKI wrestling titles on the N64.\n\nAn interesting fact highlighted in Hardcore Gaming 101's Wrestling with Pixels was Manbreeze - who later changed their name to AKI Corp, were originally part of the Human studio that created the Fire Pro series. The team grew disillusioned with being forced to rush their first 3D wrestling game in Japan - Fire Pro Wrestling Iron Slam '96 for the PS1. So they left to form the studio, Man Breeze. Interestingly, and with their origins aligned, many fans consider the best wrestling games ever were made by the developers behind Fire Pro and the AKI-built titles, like WWF No Mercy.\n\n10 WWE Day Of Reckoning 2\n\nAn Improvement On The First Game With Grappling Mechanics\n\nWWE Day of Reckoning 2\n\nPlatform(s) GameCube Released August 29, 2005 Developer(s) Yuke's\n\nWWE Day Of Reckoning 2 launched in 2005 as a GameCube exclusive. It was the last standalone WWE game to feature on a Nintendo system aside from the downscaled ports of PlayStation and Xbox games. The game was developed by Yukes but included some former members of AKI.\n\nLike its predecessors, Day of Reckoning 2 uses a grappling system similar to the AKI-developed Nintendo 64 titles combined with the Yukes wrestling engine. Only this time, the experience is more refined and improved than the previous effort, even if hit detection is still an issue. Like the N64 titles, the game uses the left shoulder button to counter strikes and the right shoulder button to reverse grapples. In addition, some submissions affect momentum and body parts. Players can even latch on a resting submission hold to regain their stamina - a feature sorely lacking in the current WWE 2K series.\n\n9 WWE Smackdown! Here Comes The Pain\n\nThe Best Game Under The Smackdown Label\n\nWWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain\n\nPlatform(s) PS2 Released October 27, 2003 Developer(s) Yuke's\n\nWWE Here Comes the Pain was released in 2003 on the PlayStation 2. It remains one of the most popular entries, with fans hoping for a modern-day remake or even a remaster since the visuals hold up surprisingly well.\n\nRelated 13 Best Wrestling Games On The PS2 The Playstation 1 era featured the infamous Monday Night Wars between the WWE and WCW. Here are the greatest PS1 games featuring wrestling.\n\nHere Comes the Pain is not the most technical or methodical grappler on this list, but it is one of the most fun and accessible. The game is fast and has arcade-like controls that are simple to pull off with crazy moves like weapon finishers, but there was a surprisingly deep move-set under the surface. Following the AKI-produced games, there were reversals for strikes and grapples mapped to separate shoulder buttons.\n\n8 WWE 2K19\n\nThe Last (and One of the Best) WWE Games Developed By Yukes\n\nWWE 2K19\n\nPlatform(s) PS4 , Xbox One , PC Released October 6, 2018 Developer(s) Yuke's , Visual Concepts\n\nTechnically, this entry could include WWE 2K17, WWE 2K18, and WWE 2K19 because, except for some additional moves, the gameplay of all three games is almost identical. The most recent titles still have the same basic system minus a few moves, but Visual Concepts remapped the button layout from WWE 2K20 onward, making some things awkward for longtime fans until they get used to it. WWE 2K19 was mechanically the most polished and felt like a wrestling game.\n\nRelated 10 Best Wrestling Games On The PS1 The original PlayStation saw the birth of some amazing wrestling games and franchises. Here are 10 of the absolute best.\n\nWWE 2K19 has a solid wrestling system that is accessible. The grappling system allows the player to target limbs with multiple high and low-impact grapples and strikes. The responsive reversal system provides good back-and-forth action when the reversal limits are turned off in the settings, and the AI adjusts itself accordingly. An excellent mechanic featured up to WWE 2K19 was chain wrestling. It allowed fans to start the matches slowly with technical wrestling and grappling.\n\nAdmittedly, the mini-game didn't resonate with everyone and was loved and hated equally. Unfortunately, this feature was removed from WWE 2K20 onward. However, for purists, it should be included as an optional extra in the settings. Finally, another feature that is sorely lacking in the latest entries is targeted grapple holds. With the grab action, players can control their opponents and target specific body parts with the shoulder buttons, which feels more meaningful when playing as a technical wrestler.\n\n7 WCW Vs. nWo: World Tour\n\nThe First AKI Wrestling Game On The N64\n\nLaunched: 1997 Developer: AKI Corporation Platform: N64\n\nWCW vs. nWo: World Tour was developed by AKI and released in 1997 on the Nintendo 64. It was the follow-up to WCW vs. The World on the PlayStation. Building upon the mechanics of its predecessor, WCW vs. nWo refined its grappling system and became the standard for wrestling titles for nearly two decades.\n\nIt also brought back the spirit meter, which means matches felt natural and more about momentum shifts than depleting a health bar. Adding to the back-and-forth action was the revolutionary reversal system. Reversals can be countered, and counters can be reversed. World Tour captured the essence of Japanese wrestling.\n\n6 WWE 2K23\n\nA Stunning Presentation Of WWE Wrestling With Tons Of Customization\n\nWWE 2K23\n\nPlatform(s) PS5 , PS4 , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S , Xbox One , PC Released March 17, 2023 Developer(s) Visual Concepts\n\nWWE 2K23 is the latest entry in the long-running series that began with Smackdown on the PS1. There is no denying it's the best-looking wrestling game ever made, and the attention to detail is second to none. The gameplay is smooth and responsive, with multiple ways to counter and reverse maneuvers.\n\nThe AI is a vast improvement but can still act out of character with certain wrestlers. Moreover, it still feels like the AI decides when the human player is finished, making it near-impossible to kick out of some pinning predicaments. Still, the AI is less predictable, making it more challenging and satisfying to reverse and mount a comeback. Moreover, players can fine-tune pinning and submission settings to make the game feel and play more like a wrestling match on TV. They can make kicking out easier for themselves and the AI so the matches can have that back-and-forth event with false finishes, close calls, and more.\n\n5 WCW/nWo: Revenge\n\nThe First WCW Wrestling Game Ever Made\n\nLaunched: 1998 Developer: AKI Corporation Platform: N64\n\nWCW/nWo: Revenge was released in 1998 for the Nintendo 64. It built upon the same grappling system featured in its predecessor, WCW vs. nWo: World Tour, improving responsiveness, animation, and move-sets. Wrestlers can now perform more accurate-looking signature moves and a new striking system.\n\nFinishers in Revenge hit with far more impact than its predecessor, with moves like the Steiner Driver and the Jackhammer looking and feeling impactful. Moreover, the AI is greatly improved when the difficulty is ramped up, but never unfair, so be prepared to be in for a long but fun match. It was the last WCW game developed by AKI before they moved on to the WWE games. It remains the best WCW game ever made.\n\n4 Fire Pro Wrestling: Returns\n\nBrought the Series To Western Audiences\n\nLaunched: 2007 Developer: Spike Platform: PS2\n\nFire Pro Wrestling: Returns was released on the PlayStation 2 in 2007. The wrestling series began in 1989, and except for the Game Boy Advance ports, Fire Pro Wrestling: Returns was the first game in the series launched in the West on home consoles. While it didn't feature official American wrestlers, it included versions of them with complete movesets and logic with a different name to avoid copyright issues. For example, Sting was renamed Spike, and Vader was renamed Saber, but fans could freely rename their favorite characters.\n\nMany grappling fans imported the Japanese-only titles for hundreds of dollars because the gameplay was so good. Returns implemented various styles of wrestling, such as WWE-style American wrestling, Japanese Strong-style, Lucha-libre, junior heavyweights, and extreme/hardcore wrestling. More importantly, the AI is on another level where winning and even losing feel like an accomplishment in hard-fought matches.\n\n3 WWF Wrestlemania 2000\n\nThe First AKI-Developed WWE Title\n\nLaunched: 1999 Developer: AKI Corporation Platform: N64\n\nWWF Wrestlemania 2000 was released on the Nintendo 64 in 1999. It was the first time that AKI developed a WWE game using the tried and tested wrestling game engine previously seen in WCW vs. nWo and WCW/nWo: Revenge. The gameplay is more or less the same as its WCW predecessor, but there were enhancements that dedicated players noticed immediately.\n\nThe counter and reversal system was even more accurate than before, and just as the developers claimed, every single move in the game can be reversed or countered if the player is skilled enough. The AI is clever, but proficient players can have competitive matches compared to the WWE action they saw on TV more than any other game in 1999. AKI launched Virtual Pro Wrestling 2 in Japan, and it utilizes the same engine but is arguably a better wrestling game that retains the test of strength and striking and grappling combos. The modding community still supports Virtual Pro Wrestling 2. Fans are recommended to try the English-patched version with new features and wrestlers.\n\n2 Fire Pro Wrestling: World\n\nThe Most Complete Wrestling Sim In The World\n\nFire Pro Wrestling World\n\nPlatform(s) PS4 , PC Developer(s) Spike Chunsoft\n\nFire Pro Wrestling: World launched on the PlayStation 4 and Steam in 2018. It arrived 11 years after its PlayStation 2 predecessor with higher resolution visuals, more moves, smoother animation, and even more depth. The AI is second to none in the wrestling genre. Better still, fans can customize a wrestler. So, they behave and perform like their real-life counterpart. In other words, wrestlers like an AI-controlled Hulk Hogan won't start a match by performing multiple flying Leg Drops from the top turnbuckle like in the WWE 2K series.\n\nIncreasing the difficulty means the CPU gains more abilities. It will crawl to the ropes, break a submission, play possum, focus on recovery, and much more. In Fire Pro Wrestling: World, the drama and psychology of a wrestling match take priority over pulling off big and flashy moves. The game forces players to wrestle strategically and create a story in the ring to please the crowd. Unlike the WWE 2K series, players will struggle to begin matches with big moves and finishers. They must work on their opponents, wear them down, and build up to the impactful attacks, or they'll get instantly reversed. The only thing that keeps Fire Pro Wrestling: World from taking the top spot is its accessibility. The mechanics and the timing take time to learn, whereas AKI's games are easy to pick up from the get-go. However, those looking for the most feature-rich wrestling sim available on modern consoles should look no further than Fire Pro Wrestling: World.\n\n1 WWF No Mercy\n\nThe Standard For All Wrestling Games\n\nWWF No Mercy\n\nPlatform(s) Nintendo 64 Released November 17, 2000 Developer Asmik Ace Entertainment, AKI Corporation\n\nThe final WWE game developed by AKI and arguably the best wrestling game of all time is WWF No Mercy for the Nintendo 64. No Mercy still worked on the same wrestling game engine as its predecessors but brought several improvements to mechanics. The reversals and counters are less of a challenge to pull off, and the addition of timing-based combos that transition into grapples added a new layer of strategy.\n\nWhat made WWF No Mercy so special was that it was more accessible than its predecessors, meaning that new players could pick it up and get right into it. Often misconceived as an arcade-style wrestling game, No Mercy has one of the most in-depth grappling systems ever seen in a game, and even the most seasoned players would keep finding new moves to discover. No Mercy has a meaningful submissions system, and the spirit meter mechanics mean that matches can go on for a long time between two skilled players. It seemingly found the balance between the chaos of the Attitude era and a Japanese-style wrestling sim to keep all players happy. The upcoming Ultra Pro Wrestling appears to nail what made the AKI-developed wrestling games so special. The game is set to launch sometime in 2024 and includes legends like Mr. Wonderful Paul Orndorff, Demolition, The Powers of Pain, and more. It's one to watch for fans of proper wrestling games.\n\nMore WWE 2K24: 13 Confirmed & Potential Matches For 40 Years Of WrestleMania Showcase The WrestleMania Showcase is returning in WWE 2K24; here are a few of the confirmed matches, along with some potential ones.",
